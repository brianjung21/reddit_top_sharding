jinro,jinro,top:month,1nltlvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1nltlvi/korea_is_this_for_real_if_yes_why/,https://i.redd.it/kvyjdvjgfaqf1.png,"Korea, is this for real? If yes, why?",Came across this chart and I’m curious if this is really true. would love to hear from locals.,"This chart shows correlation but not causation.

If 95% of all soju is sold in KR and 5% in the rest of the world, it's still the number 1 sold spirit. However it doesn't mean that soju is the number 1 drink in the rest of the world. So Latvia and Germany are higher in the list for consumption, but that's probably mainly beer, mix drinks, and wine.

A better chart would show the percentage of soju within the total alcohol consumption to really see the dominance. || I’ve seen the stat about soju being the bestselling spirit a bunch of times over the years but I’m convinced it’s absolute bullshit. 

The vast majority of soju is consumed in Korea, a country of about 50 million. 

The notion that these 50 million people consume more soju than the entire rest of the world consumes vodka, or gin, or whisky, or rum or fricking baiju in China  is… highly unbelievable.

I think it might be true that Jinro makes more soju than any other company makes a single branded spirit, but I’m dubious about that, too. Is there really more Jinro soju sold than Smirnoff vodka? 

The stats on Korean alcohol consumption should probably have some context around them too. Korea has quite a large population of non-drinkers among various  Christian sects, and women. I suspect if one looked at how much the average Korean drinker drinks, it would be way up there. But the non-drinkers are a sizable number and really bring the average down compared to countries in Europe etc. (The US is probably like Korea with a comparatively large proportion of non-drinkers too, compared to Europe.) || You need to be careful with how ""best-selling"" is defined in the first place. In this context, the stats often used are sales *volume*.

But comparing, say, 1,000 liters of 40% ABV vodka against 1,000 liters of 15-17% ABV Soju is nonsensical. || Soju is incredible cheap and plentiful and usually the strength of wine. It also does not have a reputation as being ""for"" anyone in particular; it has no class signifiers, gender signifiers or whatever. So soju is universally drunk in large volumes by a hard drinking culture at a lower strength while technically being a spirit. Comprendez? || I think it depends on your definition of spirit. Soju is about 16-25 abv % alcohol. So having a pint or two with two to three people is doable without everyone being drunk. Whereas spirits in the USA are 40% and in China even higher. So volume wise I can easily see more soju being consumed per capita than in other countries.",comments,korea,Proper-Scientist972,123,123,0.84,59,False,False,False,False,,,문화 | Culture,i.redd.it,1758360163.0,2025-09-20T09:22:43+00:00

Not just the taste, but the whole ritual around it. Back home, I expected it to be cheap like in Korea, but local store prices felt like a joke. Bottles that cost $1.50 over there were going for $8 - $12 here. That led me on a six-month hunt to figure out where to get the best deals without ending up with counterfeit or questionable bottles.

The first thing I learned is that soju pricing depends heavily on distribution rights in your country. Big importers often lock down certain brands, then mark them up because they’re the only ones bringing them in. This is why you’ll sometimes find Jinro at twice the price in one city compared to another.

Duty-free shops are worth checking, but only if you’re already traveling. Seoul’s Incheon Airport and some Japanese airports have bundle deals, I think around six-packs for less than what two bottles cost in the States. The problem is, you have to fit them in your luggage and watch the liquid restrictions.

Local Korean markets are usually cheaper than mainstream liquor stores, especially if you buy by the case. Some will quietly give discounts if you’re a regular and ask. This is also where I learned about lesser-known brands that taste just as good as Jinro or Chamisul but cost less because they’re not heavily marketed abroad.

Online is where it gets interesting. Some specialty alcohol retailers partner with overseas distributors to ship direct, and prices can be much closer to what you’d pay in Asia, shipping being the main factor. I even found suppliers on Alibaba who cater to restaurants and bars, offering wholesale pricing if you’re willing to meet their minimum order quantities. For the flavored sojus especially, this worked out to a little bit above half the per-bottle price of local retail.

Seasonal demand plays a role too. Around Lunar New Year and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving), big importers run promotions to clear extra stock. If you watch for those windows, you can stock up for months at better prices.

After months of tracking, my cheapest consistent sources are:

–Local Korean markets for single bottles or small case deals

–International market restaurant suppliers for bulk flavored soju orders

–Duty-free bundles when I’m already traveling through Asia

Anyway, so I wasn't sure what to expect because the Bulgogi Alfredo was a disaster, corn starch + sugar + 3-4 sweeteners. This one only had one sweetener, I checked, personally I didn't feel it much and it didn't ruin the flavor. 

So the weird thing is that ""Rose"" generally refers to a mix of cream and tomato, this one really didn't feel like it had cream flavor, it's closest to a bolognese / arrabiata. I think the powder was cheese, although it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it dissolved into the sauce and was totally OK, fairly neutral really.

 I actually can't decide if the flakes were tomato or kimchi, there isn't a lot of kimchi flavor honestly. If you want a good kimchi flavor, get the Kimchi Ramen block from Jongga. 

So yeah, pretty ok 'long noodles' with a very, VERY mildly spicy (""piquant"", honestly barely spicy at all) tomato sauce, with a bit of added but not overpowering sweetness. 

Verdict, ""not bad"", good if you're being super lazy, you could totally add mushrooms. Personally at this rate I'd just make the ""Napolitaner"" pasta dish with ketchup, canned tomatoes, and a bit of Japanese tonkatsu sauce, with spam at the start in a frying pan, and that'd be extremely similar honestly. I wouldn't call it unique but at least it exceeded my expectations (which were low, the Bulgogi Alfredo was really bad).",,selftext,InstantRamen,Zhuinden,21,21,1.0,3,False,False,False,False,,,Korean Instant Noodles,reddit.com,1757969775.0,2025-09-15T20:56:15+00:00

Last weekend I moved into my new place; a group of villas in a developing area. The only thing within walking distance is a convenience store. 

My first night at my place, I walked over for some Buldak noodles. I ate there since I literally had nothing but the 3 suitcases I came with. The owner said something about liking spicy food to me and was very helpful in explaining (albeit it in Korean, which I don’t speak) where I could dump my ramen water and helped make sure I got the deals with the 1+1 goodies. 

I’ve been in about twice since then. Tonight I stopped in for a quick snack and a sweet treat to cap the night. When I rung up, he ran to the back and got a bag of these home grown Korean chille peppers for me. He kept saying how spicy they were. It was all very endearing. It’s a nice motivator to learn more Korean so that I can communicate more with him. 


South Korea is amazing for food, cafes, and their love for fur babies. But gyat dayum if the people aren’t great here. Everyone from my landlord to the local convenience store owner has been so unbelievably kind.

I’m honestly mourning right now. Can anyone recommend me some mild ramens that are any good (and don’t say Shin Toomba, I’ve had it and it’s ass)

He never speak, he never says hello to me when we see each other, we never text. He has his own separate life and so do I and that’s just how it’s been. I find him very condescending, every time I try to have a conversation with him he’s extremely blunt and disinterested and he always tries to seem authority over me as he’s older. I have very little respect for him due to growing distance over the past couple of years, and he doesn’t respect me. 

He also doesn’t have any respect for my personal belongings, for example, he takes all of our stuff without asking and then gets defensive and argumentative when we call him out on it.

I bought a 5 pack of buldak noodles for myself which cost me the guts of £12, myself and my partner were going to have some for tea that evening as there were only two packs left. I walk through the door and the first thing my brother asks me is “can I have one pack of our buldak noodles” no hello or hi or how was your day to which I then replied “no”, he turned around and told me that they were for his girlfriend who I like as she is always kind and respectful to me, she’s also a guest to which I then felt uncomfortable saying no to so I changed my mind and said yes. I then proceeded into the kitchen and took a yogurt that I bought myself. He mistaken the yogurt for his as he originally bought a pack but then ate them all. He turned to me and then said “oh so it’s okay for you to take my stuff without asking but you can take mine with no issue”, I got confused and said “no these are mine” and he proceeded to raise his voice and say “no they fucking aren’t”, I pointed out that he had only bought one packet and he ate them all (which he was well aware of) and then he turned around and said that he had bought two  and then proceeded to tell me to “shut the fuck up” when I tried to defend myself. I then pulled out my digital receipt and showed him my fucking proof of purchase to which he turned around and began to yell at me to fuck off and to shut the fuck up and to go fuck myself blah blah blah because I had apparently “not let it go” and that he had apparently turned around and said “oh nevermind” when I told him that he never bought a second pack (surprise surprise this didn’t happen). 

Anyways he and his gf stormed out of the house and came back like 3 hours later. I could tell the gf was uncomfortable with my 
presence and I went up and apologised about the fight. She turned around to me and said that we all need to have a talk later because she doesn’t think I understand how my words affect my brother. And apparently me saying no to him having the noodles but yes to her having the noodles really upset him. They are painting it out that I’m the arsehole and I know that they are going to be doing that during this “talk” later. I just need to know if I was an arsehole or not so I have a clear conscious going into this fucking meeting 

EDIT: Sorry for making the living situation so confusing. We are at our parents home, they are on holidays so it’s just myself and my brother.

Something you always have at home. It's so common that we don't really have discussions or communities dedicated to it.

What's really surprising to me is seeing how popular Shin Ramyun is here. For decades, it's been the undisputed number one ramen in Korea, but I always thought it wasn't as well-known overseas. I thought Buldak was pretty much the only Korean ramen foreigners knew about, but looking at this community, I can see I was wrong.

And I wanted to share some of the other instant ramens that Koreans love. There are so many kinds—Yukgaejang, Neoguri, Twigim-Udon, Jjapagetti, Chamkkae Ramen, Moopama and more. Now that I think about it, almost all of these are Nongshim products. I guess a lot of Koreans' go-to ramens are from Nongshim.

Anyway, thanks so much for the love for Korean ramen! Hope you all keep enjoying it!

So when I saw this for 99c at my local grocer, I had to give 'em a try. 

Spiciness - Weak... in flavor. Spicy poops? REAL. The costs outweighed the benefit. 

Flavor - Aight. Pretty good. But it was better with some kewpie, parmesan, and chili oil to enhance. 

Noodles - Maruchan is an OG in the noodle game. Definitely good. 

They're a deal, the flavor is fine, and they're a decent base. I use about half the packet then add more on my own to make them bomb. Comparable to Buldak? Nah. But I respect the option.

For 10 months now I have been on a pretty significant calorie deficit, never going more than 300 calories over my daily allotment or 500 calories over in a week, and have had excellent results across the board.  But I am just not able to justify eating certain things, even in moderation, because of how much they screw with my overall calorie/macro goals for that day or week.

Let's start with rice. I fuckin LOVE rice, it is one of my all-time favorite things to eat. Back in the day, one of my go-to quick lunches or dinners that I ate at least 3x per week was a pack of buldak noodles + soft-boiled egg + a cup of rice. Seriously, just give me a giant bowl heaping with rice, maybe a little butter or soy sauce, and I feel like I'm in heaven. However, an actual serving size of rice is pathetically small, small to the point that it pisses me off, which means I have completely cut it from my diet. I've only had a single serving of rice since December. It seemed like such an absolute waste of calories when you compare the volume of a serving of rice to the volume of a serving of potatoes or pasta. So, now I don't eat any rice and I gave away all that I had left in the house. 

The same goes with things like chips/candy/nuts/cookies/snacks in general. You mean to tell me that 10 cashews is 100 calories? GTFOHWTS! 2 oreos is 1 serving?! What am I, an infant?!?! If I can't have a pile of them, I don't want any of them! It just isn't worth it to me for all the cuts I would have to make elsewhere to make the numbers work.

A couple months ago I went out for burgers with a friend of mine for his birthday, and it took like 2 days of cutting calories by a couple hundred calories per day just so I could fit into my allotment. The burger was absolutely excellent, but it wasn't worth being hungry for 3 days to make up for it.

It is infinitely easier to completely eliminate a thing than to have a little bit of it, and if that thing is only delaying your success or putting undue stress on figuring out how to incorporate it into your goals, why would you make the choice to include it? I suppose it would be easier to fit these things into my day-to-day life if I had more calories to play with, so maybe when I shift to maintenance, my view will change.

A shame because I quite like their beef bulgogi pasta and love their Buldak products. ",,selftext,InstantRamen,journalling_addixt,111,111,0.97,23,False,False,False,False,,,Korean Instant Noodles,reddit.com,1758638764.0,2025-09-23T14:46:04+00:00

personally, i think it tastes a lot like buldak with a twist. it’s a little sweeter, more tangy, and has a well-rounded flavor which i liked. the noodles are a little bouncy?? i have no idea how to explain it but i love the texture of the noodles. it’s less creamier than buldak but a bit more flavorful. it’s surprising that i found these to be spicier in comparison but idk if that’s just me. overall really good in my opinion!

For anyone wondering:

* Bulduk 2x Spicy Ramen
* Spicy Garlic Ramen topping (Search ramen toppings on Amazon)
* Pan fried steak in chili oil (Frozen, you can find bags of it in any super market, don't need much)
* Pickled Jalapenos (personal pick Mezzetta's regular for a spicy mix)
* 2x Soft boiled eggs (fried over easy works too)
* 1x Fresh jalapenos (Better if you can sub fresh thai pepper, especially if you marinate with rice vinegar and fish sauce) and 1x Habanero (Optional again but adds color)
* Cilantro (Optional, good for garnish)
* Green onions and/or white onion
* Fresh squeezed lime

Then dash of both Flatiron Sweet Asian Reds and Smoke Show.  This isn't a challenge but rather just an everyday spice level and easy way to make a hearty lunch. I also encourage to experiment (Garlic, exotic peppers, spinach, tofu, bok choy, various types of mushrooms, freeze dried shrimp, kale, peas, carrots, pulled pork etc). I tend to mix it up so it doesn't get old.

**How to cut cost**

If you're in a bind, and looking to cut cost, the keys are green onions (or chopped white onion) + cheap ramen toppings (look on amazon) + egg + pickled jalapenos + cheap ramen and last, fried or soft boiled eggs.  You're looking about $20ish for about 6\~ meals, less if you buy the real cheap ramen and thanks to the eggs, not entirely nutritionally vacant and more filling because of the protein. If you're looking to make it a bit healthier by adding fiber and greens, bok choy or spinach and/or corn. Frozen spinach works. I did this in college to impress a lady or two. It's a meal to keep in your back pocket as you can make the presentation look impressive if you use ingredients with different colors.

For spice on the cheap version: Srirachas + spicy pepper flakes or powder will get you pretty far, and most ingredients keep for a long time. This is an inexpensive way to live a little on a budget on ingredients that keep for a bit.",,title,spicy,BourbonicFisky,94,94,0.98,11,False,False,False,False,,,,i.redd.it,1758353085.0,2025-09-20T07:24:45+00:00

And all jokes aside it was REALLY good so I went back to get more and also got the spicy one this time as well.

I added more photos this time for those who wanted to see more of what the product actually looked like. 

This is definitely a noodle for the Creamy Buldak fans. I did not expect it to be as spicy as it was. (I love buldak btw but I can’t have it anymore ever since I developed IBS 🫠 so I know I’ll regret this later) flavor was good, definitely a solid spicy noodle, not over powering I’d compare it most closely to the Cream Carbonara Buldak in spice/flavor.    

The noodles are a nice thin chewy glass noodle and the tteokbokki is a good texture. I really think the “holes” do make the texture better for a microwave tteokbokki. Just cooks through better. 

A lot of people wanted to know where I got it from and I’m sorry to disappoint but I got it from a local shop so unless you in Columbus, Ohio I can’t help much in that regard!

Like sure I love the spice and taste combined. But sometimes im feeling for buldak just cause of the  good taste, and genuinely I want to know. Do you guys know of anything that tastes like buldak just not spicy?..

Very chewy noodles if cooked right and just the right amount of spice, which is a lot more than Shin red but way less than the inedible Buldak straight from devil's ass.

\- Shin Ramyun Premium Black: I liked this one a lot more - I should note I tried both with the ""ramen hack"" that's been going around on tiktok (the one with kewpie mayo, and garlic), but wish the noodles was as juicy as the ones in the Carbonara Buldak Ramen.

Just some quick hits. I'm currently in the process of moving to another state.

The JML Chicken & Mushroom is good. If you see it, grab a 5 Pk. The Doll Spicy Pork is neither Pork in flavor. Nor is it Spicy. You could feed this to a 2 year old. But, if you do feed this to a 2 year old. You will be charged with child abuse.

Photos 2-8 are ramens I've never see. If you've tried one or two. Drop a quick line. The last is Tom Yum, made it myself. Tasted pretty good w/o comparing it to packaged Yum. The staple items were Prawns 1lb, 10-20. 1 fillet of Tilapia. Got a Costco big bag. Gotta use it somehow. Threw in the standard fixin's. And, I did smash the prawn heads in the pot. Gotta get that brain juice goodness.

I'm letting go of Buldak. It's not fun for me anymore. I've discovered way too many ramens I like more. And brands too. I've never had one where it actually tasted like Chicken. Maruchan Roasted Chicken and Creamy Chicken have more and better chicken flavor than buldak. All it is to me now is a generic spice note and heat that overpowers everything.  If you did blind tastings, could you pick out any Flavor profile and say this taste like xxx. With a hint of xxx on the backend. With the heat being a non-factor. Just what flavor is it. And what other taste are in there. The heat would let you know its buldak. Now, which one is it?

I've been getting into a lot of ramen brands from Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia lately. It's opened up a whole new part of the ramen world to me.

After my move is complete. And I'm settled in. I'll post regular full reviews again. In addition to the ""Cooked Per"" review. I'll have a ""Mini"" review of extras that I think are worthy. And how they add or complement the featured ramen's flavor profile.

I put the Nissan Demae Chicken in rotation. I reviewed it [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/InstantRamen/comments/1jpfirt/ramen_thoughts_nissin_japanese_demae_chicken/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). It has grown on me. And as I previously stated. It does take extras well.

My mom (60F, I am adopted) had asked me if I wanted spaghetti that she had made for visitors yesterday, since there was a bit left over. I had been craving buldak for a bit so I politely said no. So I went to make the buldak at the same time she started heating up the spaghetti (I was hungry guys) and waited for the water to heat up. She decided to pour some of said water into the spaghetti. I didn’t really mind at first, but was a bit iffy about it. once the water was heated, I put the buldak in, what do ya know, there’s not enough water in the pot. So I poured more water in and let it cook. She started stirring it, then chopping it into chunks. I personally do not like my ramen in chunks, it’s harder to pick up (with a fork at least) so I told her “___, I got it, it’s okay I know what I’m doing.” She got upset, started saying I can’t take advice and that I always get upset when she tries to “help me”. Mind you, I have constantly asked her to help me learn to cook, but she never takes the time to teach me. She is unemployed, so she has the ability to take some time out for me but doesn’t. I took it to myself to learn to at least make stuff like pancakes, ramen and eggs.

Anyway, I feel like I was polite, I wanted to let her that I knew what I was doing to avoid her making it something I eventually didn’t want to eat. (Not saying her cooking is bad, it’s great, just some things she does with her food, especially pasta, are things I personally do not like). But then again, I am 16 and may be a little less wise.

One of the reasons why k-pop went viral was because of Koreas culture, K-boos, oppars and eonnis, buldak ramyeon, hanbok and k-dramas. For thailand i could imagine it being Thais ""sabai"" culture, ladyboys, mama ramen, street food, chut thai and BLs/GLs/Lakorn.

Before yall bash me for ALWAYS mentioning k-pop here, let me just remind you that t-pop is extremely and heavily inspired by k-pop. I consider asian pop (p-pop, c-pop, j-pop, v-pop, l-pop) all being in the same bubble as k-pop while all other western genres are in another bubble. 

1. International social media connection
Yep, its true. K-pop is not superior for going global without much use of social media. Its because of hard work since the 90s. And t-pop started in around 2010s, only focusing on thais, laos etc. While k-pop was already dominating asia. So i think if t-pop plays well with social media, it could get global within a few years. Also, i know i mention YG""MM a lot, but its because it will actually make a difference. Most agencies (TADA, XOXO, LIT, LOVEIS) focus mostly on asian audience, because they don't really know how to play the western game yet. But YG knows alot, so YG maybe would make a trend in the t-pop industry, inspiring other agencies to try promote to western audience too. 

(Before yall talk about the t-pop groups like Jasp.er and LYKN, lets just be honest. They are really talented, but without BL, they wouldnt have as much fans as they do. So i mean groups like PiXXiE, 4EVE, BUS and DICE.)

Also, very important is more people from around asia. Bring more languages, including english in. If they could make funny and relatable content like Keeho, Lily, Beomhan, Prince etc. They will become more relevant.

2. Differentiate from K-pop
We need a more distinct tone, or characteristics that make t-pop t-pop.
So its already well known that scandals or toxicity doesn't really exist in t-pop. I think that can be a characteristic. More LGBTQIA+ representation, groups with dancy music inspired by luk thung or mor lam. I think that would be a great idea, and a great way to find a identity.

3. 3 words, MERCH, MERCH, MERCH!!!
Lightsticks, Those little face fans (that BUS has for example), Shirts, Albums, Photobooks, physical book Guides aka a cute book to introduce you to a group with fun biographys, and little games like who would rather, or each members favorite show, style and music. 2 versions, Thai and English. And obviously International shipping.

4. More festivals, for example: T-Pop on Tour, T-pop Festival etc. More music shows aside with T-pop stage and TMC. Live sessions, and little variety shows hosted by other idols. (Like Youngji)

Let me know what you think, if i should add a step? Is it realistic? Would it work?",,selftext,TPOP,One_Conclusion2878,8,8,1.0,20,False,False,True,False,,,[DISCUSSION],self.TPOP,1756922285.0,2025-09-03T17:58:05+00:00

Analysts attribute the surge to growing expectations surrounding collaborations such as the Netflix animation \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim, once the leader in South Korea’s domestic ramen market, lost its position as the top ramen stock to Samyang Foods in May last year. While Nongshim’s stock price saw little movement, Samyang Foods’ shares soared, driven by its Buldak Ramen. At the shareholders’ meeting in March, complaints erupted: “A company’s competitiveness lies in its market capitalization, and Nongshim is lacking.”

Nongshim’s sluggish stock price began to rebound, riding on the popularity of \*KPop Demon Hunters\*. Reactions continued that the cup ramen and snacks featured in the series reminded viewers of Shin Ramyun and Shrimp Crackers. Nongshim confirmed the collaboration with Netflix, releasing limited-edition products featuring characters from \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim plans to sustain this momentum. The company has set specific targets: achieving sales of 7.3 trillion Korean won and an operating profit margin of 10% by 2030. It also aims to expand overseas sales to 61% of total revenue.

Nongshim has partnered with Netflix to release a product featuring characters from 'KPop Demon Hunters'. /Courtesy of Nongshim

For background, I am the oldest daughter of four kids. My parents have always had a difficult relationship with each other. I have grown up with a hot and cold parenting style. To simplify, let’s say I’m coming home from school, and I do not know if I’m coming home to happy parents or angry/upset ones. Their mood (especially my dad’s) can change very quickly at any point and time in the day. My dad gets upset over the smallest things, jumps to conclusions, doesn’t like to admit when he’s wrong, and when he does—he gives sorry ass apologies, and usually ruins everyone’s moods. He’s often mad or upset. Usually, their tone of voice when responding to me tells me whether or not we are going to have a calm or tense home for the time being. Don’t get my parents wrong, they can definitely be very loving and great people. But, they obviously have a lot of emotional immaturity within them that falls onto my siblings and me. And perhaps that’s why my parents often argue since (I personally think) they don’t have a lot of compatibility. Both have very strong personalities. Over the years I have grown this resentment towards them, to the point where my patience with them is very thin. So I can get easily annoyed when they are simply speaking to me or in the same room as me, even if they aren’t doing anything wrong. 

Anyway, today after I got off work with my mom (because my sister and I also help my parents by working for them and their small business since they cannot afford to hire anyone else) I decided that I wanted some buldak noodles. As I was in the kitchen starting my prep my sister asked me to make her some as well. As I minced the garlic I asked her to start to boil some water so I could cook the noodles when ready. I didn’t realize she ended using 1/2 pans we have which are kind of like a pan and pot fusion. As I looked through the shelves of clean cookware, I could not find an actual pan so I used the other pot + pan fusion to fry some eggs. I’ll just call it pat to make it simpler. I turn the other stove on and put some oil. I'm talking to my sister and not even a minute and a half later a pretty decent-sized fire erupted from the pat. I freak out because I have never experienced this before. I immediately turn off the stove. The kitchen starts to fill with smoke and the smoke detectors go off. I’m going back and forth within the kitchen trying to think about what to do, my siblings go and get our parents—and like the universe did not hate me more, one of my neighbor’s cars goes off too while all of this is happening. I grab a small pot, fill it with some water, and throw it onto the fire and pat. It went out. Luckily nothing was burned, but there was a lot of smoke. As my parents came into the kitchen my dad immediately started yelling at me asking what the hell we did. My mom points out that there’s water on the pat and stove. I’m still freaking out so I was yelling as I was explaining that I was about to fry some eggs while the pat caught on fire. My dad asks me why I’m yelling as we are all opening windows and turning on fans. I’m still yelling trying to explain what just happened. My dad is also the type of person when he’s upset to say a lot of side comments or just unnecessary things in the moment, so he says to me, “You need to stop with that attitude.” I get more upset and reply with “You need to stop acting like you don’t do the same thing.” He continues going on saying I’m the only person yelling and that is mad, that if he’s yelling he can show me what yelling really is. I say, “This is why I don’t like spending time with you.” He acts confused and angrily walks to his room while saying, “Fine if you don’t want to spend time with me, then don’t. I do this and that for you…” and you can fill in the blank. I feel guilty because I can see a lot of him in me. But I try to be better and recognize when I’m wrong. Please let me know what you think.

I’ve just released the trailer for my debut feature *Premature*, a Glasgow-set rom-com about two flatmates who wind up pregnant after a one-night stand.

I have a bit of experience operating camera on factual and light entertainment TV, but I’m fairly new to shooting fiction.

In addition to being the cinematographer on the film, I was also the writer, director, and producer. I’m not sure I’d do all those roles again!

**Camera & Lenses**

Shot on my Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K Pro. Samyang VDSLR primes with ¼ Black Pro-Mist. The 24mm and 50mm were the workhorses, with occasional use of the 14mm, 35mm, and 135mm.

Acquired in 6K BRAW, editing in 4K. In hindsight, 6K was probably overkill, but it gave me flexibility for reframing and punch-ins. Although I tried to get my framing right on the day!

**Lighting**

For daytime exteriors I leaned heavily on natural light, using bounce, diffusion, and negative fill. I tried to schedule the exteriors so that the actors were backlit, but it wasn’t always possible.

Interiors were lit with a small lighting package (2x Neewer CB300Bs, 1x Godox FL150S, 2x LED tubes, 2x small magnetic LEDs). It tried to keep things simple, using a single source, supplemented by practicals.

One of my favourite shots ended up being lit almost entirely with the ceiling fixture in the location, shaped with black wrap and a bounced into a poly for fill.

**Operating & Movement**

About 90% of the film was shot handheld or on sticks, with the occasional push-in on a dolly/slider. I mostly pulled my own focus; I wish I could have afforded a 1^(st) AC!

Anyway, I’d love to know your thoughts on the trailer. If you have any questions about the process, I’d be happy to answer them.",,selftext,cinematography,kwalls89,183,183,0.96,60,False,False,False,False,,,Original Content,v.redd.it,1758064282.0,2025-09-16T23:11:22+00:00

I considered the budget options — used Sigma 28-70mm, Sigma 24-70mm Art II, Lumix S Pro 24-70mm, and even Lumix S 24-105mm f/4. In the end, I decided to sacrifice the longer reach and go with a brand new Lumix S 24-60 f/2.8 for its price point, lighter weight and weather-resistance.

I’ve just released the trailer for my debut feature Premature, a Glasgow-set romantic comedy about two flatmates who wind up pregnant after a one-night stand.

I wanted to share a bit about how we made it and what I learned, in case it’s useful for anyone else working on micro-budget projects:

**Development & Writing**

I started writing the film in the summer of 2024. Initially, I planned to raise private equity to finance the film, but I decided it was unlikely that anyone would want to invest in a first-time feature director. So I started saving instead.

I paid for coverage from The Black List and ScreenCraft to see if the script was strong enough to justify spending the next few years of my life making it, and I also got notes from filmmaker friends. You might argue that money spent on coverage services could have gone into the production budget, but I stand by the decision. The feedback was honest and, even if I didn’t action every note, it made the script much stronger.

At its longest, the script was 100 pages long, but I couldn’t afford to shoot that many pages. I cut scenes, combined scenes, and merged characters. Before we started shooting, I got it down to 89 pages, and by then I had written about 17 drafts. As I was wearing multiple hats, having the script locked and solid before we started shooting allowed me to focus on the task at hand: making the film.

**Budget & Schedule**

The film was self-financed with a production budget of around £13,000. We shot over 22.5 days with a core cast and crew of 5: two actors, a cinematographer, a camera assistant, and a boom operator. Having a small crew meant we could afford to shoot for more days. It also meant we built a strong rapport and the energy on the set was consistently positive.

Along the way, we were joined by a wonderful group of supporting actors, background actors, additional crew, and production assistants. Everyone had a blast and a bunch of people offered to come back to help whenever they could. Of course, extra bodies meant extra catering costs, so I went over budget there. Whether it was coffee in the morning or ice cream at lunch, little treats throughout the day kept morale high. Totally worth it.

**Camera & Lenses**

We shot on my Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K Pro with Samyang VDSLR primes and a ¼ Black Pro-Mist filter. The 24mm and 50mm did most of the heavy lifting, with occasional use of the 14mm, 35mm, and 135mm. 

As much as I would have liked to shoot on an Alexa with nice glass, I don’t think it would have made a huge difference. I would still be in the one behind the camera – blocking and framing the shots – in the same locations with the same lighting setup. I couldn’t afford kit rental anyway! The best camera is the one you can afford to buy, rent, or borrow.

Apart from the occasional push in on a dolly/slider, the film was shot handheld or on sticks. I mostly pulled my own focus; I wish I could have afforded a 1^(st) AC for the entire shoot.

We acquired in 6K, BRAW, and I’m editing in 4K. Probably overkill.

**Lighting**

For daytime exteriors I leaned heavily on natural light, using bounce, diffusion, and negative fill. I tried to schedule the exteriors so the sun would backlight the actors, but it wasn’t always possible. 

Interiors were covered with a small lighting package (2x Neewer CB300B, 1x Godox FL150S, 2x LED tubes, 2x small magnetic LEDs), supported by practicals. My approach to lighting was to keep things as simple as possible, often opting for a single source which I would bounce and cut.

For example, I lit one scene using the ceiling fixture that was already at the location. I spent ages in prep worrying about how I was going to light the scene, but the solution was the simple. All I needed was a bit of black wrap to control the spill and a polyboard for some fill.

**Locations**

Most of our locations were sourced through friends, family, and colleagues. However, we had to hire several key locations that were crucial to the story, including a museum, a hospital, and an ultrasound clinic. It would have been easier and cheaper to write a script utilising locations I could access for free, but I wouldn’t have been able to tell the story I wanted to tell.

**Next Steps**

The film is assembled and I’m working on the rough cut. We’re crowdfunding to raise funds for colour grading, sound design, and music, with the goal of beginning festival submissions in spring 2026.",,selftext,Filmmakers,kwalls89,116,116,0.97,78,False,False,False,False,,,Film,youtu.be,1758209943.0,2025-09-18T15:39:03+00:00

Very versatile and I’ll eventually replace it. For now, I’m looking for an ultra wide prime under $1000 and my top two options are the 16mm 1.8 and 20 mm 1.8. I’m open to other suggestions, but I’d prefer a prime with f1.8 for low light and I have the ability to crop in, so a zoom isn’t critical.

I shoot wide subjects often, such as landscapes, storms, indoor architecture and occasionally get into some creative street photography like the image above at 16mm. Sometimes 16mm isn’t quite wide enough. 

The 14mm 1.8 is very tempting, but it’s a bit out of my price range and would still leave me with a big gap up to 28mm, so I figured a fisheye + a prime can make up for it and give me more versatility.

I just ordered the Samyang 12mm 2.8 fisheye since it was nearly $200 off at B&H for $305 USD and seemed like a steal for a decent quality lens. Alpha Blogs rates it at 4/5 and while I’m skeptical about using it on an a7rV, I see it as more of a fun lens to play around with and not pixel peep too hard.

I have compiled all my photos and read out the metadata to find what my style seems to be. Perhaps this is interesting to some of you too.

About me and the data: I'm a hobby photographer and often shoot landscapes, architecture, flowers, friends, family. I basically try to keep a photo diary and I have taken photos on average every second day of this year. In total I have analysed 11798 photos taken between 20.08.2024 and 30.08.2025.

# Focal Lengths:

https://preview.redd.it/s09flf946dmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd526f6f74bbe2bbbf1c444df5060fba8f16ed55

As expected, both edges (18mm & 55mm) are used quite often. It makes sense, even if I'd actually like 12mm or 90mm, I'll have to limit myself to those two extremes or switch lenses.  
Interestingly, I seem to prefer the 30-40mm range when it comes to those inbetween lengths.

*Takeaway 1: Longer and shorter focal lengths are needed.*  
*Takeaway 2: If I'm buying a prime, something around 35mm will be best.*

# Exposures:

https://preview.redd.it/bsrwqgfqddmf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3da891368271eeeb5ee3b94ad1fa3b88f18ee1

This one is a bit harder to read but not much. We see here the decimal power of the speed. So if I'm shooting 1/100s (the camera dial with simply read 100), then that corresponds to 10². As you can see, 1/125s and 1/250s are my favourites. Fast enough to not blur most subjects but letting in enough light to use a lower ISO. You can also see a bump around 1/1000, which is often the default in sunlight, and 1/60 which I use indoors, though some people looks blurry at that setting.

I often use aperture priority, so this may also reveal a preference of the X-T2 software?

*Takeaway 3: More light is more good, getting the 1/60 to 1/125 would mean less blur.*

# ISOs

https://preview.redd.it/i6bbdp6k7dmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba0094d46f648b00751ddd71acabc8c5b8a5187

This one hurts to look at. I had no idea, how often the auto ISO has to go incredibly high to compensate for my other settings. Apart from one clear winner (ISO 800) it's a somewhat even spread. ISO 800 is a special case as the DR400 setting requires a minimum of ISO 800, and I use that quite often. The higher ISOs (particularly 10000+) are all indoor photos, where I forced the camera into 1/60s else my photos become completely blurry with people moving and talking.

Yes, I want my ISO to be <2000 (I know, still not low...) but if my aperture is all the way open, the SS is as long as I can get it without blur, and a flash is no good option, then I'll take ISO 12800 over a very dark image tbh.

*Takeaway 4: We didn't see it in the SS, but indoor shots NEED a wider aperture for enough light! 10x more light would be ideal, that corresponds to F0.85 compared to my F2.8 at the wider end. Oh boy.*

# Apertures:

https://preview.redd.it/9bs9qb5f9dmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25209e9611c46cb78551bd460763dbbacb1baa7

As expected: I stick to the widest aperture possible most of the time. F2.8-4.0 are all dependent on the focal length as I usually don't step down to F4 if a wider aperture is possible. The lens opens to F3.2 at 23mm, F3.6 at 35mm, and F4.0 at 40mm+.

I sometimes use F8 for better sharpness and more focus on the background, but not often.

The F22 shots are all attempts at long exposures in harsh sunlight without an ND filter. Often still too bright and I would have used F40 if that was an option.

*Takaway 5: Buy ND filters for long exposures.*  
*Takaway 6: I use the widest apertures anyway, so getting a wider aperture will not go unused.*

# Conclusion:

What's needed are a wider angle lens (12mm? 10mm?), a longer zoom (90mm? 200mm?) and a lot more aperture. Plus perhaps a good 35mm prime.

I recently got the XF 35mm F2 and it has been brilliant. Much better than the 18-55mm at 35mm. With F2 compared to F3.6 it lets in 3.2x as much light and this obviously also impacts the bokeh by a lot. Plus it's sharper and more vibrant.

I'm looking at a good wide angle lens without fisheye distortions but have yet to decide. I already have the 18mm F2 and it improves on the bokeh and light issues, but not enough. And I still feel restricted, as 18mm is not wide enough most of the time I use that lens.

The 90mm F2 seems like a good choice for the wider end. I already have the 135mm F2 Samyang (for full frame cameras) but the manual focus makes it quite hard to use outside of dedicated portrait shoots.

My long term goal is to replace the 18-55mm entirely. After seeing what the 35mm F2 is capable of, I have kept that on my camera basically since buying it. If I can get the right primes, I might not need the zoom anymore, no matter how versatile I find it to be.

After starting as an ardent defender of zooms for their versatility, I have come to the decision that primes, though a bit less neat in the bag, are simply better in terms of the images they can provide.

These are some of my favorites :),"In 2023 I switched from my GH5 to the S5ii and haven't looked back since! I love using the Sigma 16-28 f2.8 for photography while hanging on a rope above the climber. The Samyang 35-150 has been an allrounder beast for potraits and taking pictures across the crag. I also experimented with a 9 mm ultra wide and Sigma 150-600. 

Overall I'm extremely happy with the perfomance, the AF and especially the low light ability. Since climbing isn't a super fast sport I don't need extreme burst rates and super fast AF.

A major plus point is that my buddy with whom I shoot climbing videos also has an S5ii and now the colours are easy to match and we can switch lenses and copy settings.

The incredible stabilizer is also a major plus point for us, since we are hanging in stressful positions and can't have a gimbal, but with the S5ii you don't even need it. 

Something I really appreciate about Lumix are the software updates. Several major features, that I use a lot have been added after I purchased the camera like handheld high res, stronger e-stabilization and hybrid zoom (it's hard to switch lenses hanging on a rope, so that was extra cool at the beginning of this year).

I now got a S9 as a second body for when I'm shooting alone and also really look forward to trying it out!",,selftext,Lumix,L4ndolini,95,95,1.0,11,False,False,False,False,,,L-Mount (OC),reddit.com,1758743428.0,2025-09-24T19:50:28+00:00

Anyway, so I wasn't sure what to expect because the Bulgogi Alfredo was a disaster, corn starch + sugar + 3-4 sweeteners. This one only had one sweetener, I checked, personally I didn't feel it much and it didn't ruin the flavor. 

So the weird thing is that ""Rose"" generally refers to a mix of cream and tomato, this one really didn't feel like it had cream flavor, it's closest to a bolognese / arrabiata. I think the powder was cheese, although it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it dissolved into the sauce and was totally OK, fairly neutral really.

 I actually can't decide if the flakes were tomato or kimchi, there isn't a lot of kimchi flavor honestly. If you want a good kimchi flavor, get the Kimchi Ramen block from Jongga. 

So yeah, pretty ok 'long noodles' with a very, VERY mildly spicy (""piquant"", honestly barely spicy at all) tomato sauce, with a bit of added but not overpowering sweetness.

Here's a shot of my advanced astrophotography rig: my beloved X-S20, the trusty XF 18-55mm, and my secret weapon for achieving perfect focus... a splatter guard from my kitchen.

Believe it or not, holding it in front of the lens worked surprisingly well as a makeshift Bahtinov mask to get the stars tack sharp!
The problem is, now that my focus is on point, I've confirmed what I already suspected: the 18-55mm, as versatile as it is, is just too slow at f/2.8 (at the wide end) to really pull in the faint details of the night sky.

So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom here. I'm looking to get a dedicated, faster, and wider lens for astrophotography. I'm based on the island of Rhodes in Greece, so I'm lucky to have some amazing dark skies to take advantage of.

I'm mainly interested in capturing wide shots of the Milky Way.

What lens would you recommend for the X-S20? I've seen a lot about the Samyang/Rokinon 12mm f/2.0 and the Viltrox 13mm f/1.4. Are these the way to go, or are there other options I should be considering?

But have been craving a wide lens for stadium shots, and also shots of the stands with fans. I was caught between the Samyang 16mm T1.4 Prima and the Sony G Master lenses. So I actually tried out the others. But, ended up taking the 16mm. 

My first impression is wow. 

* The lens has basically zero distortion. Way better than the Sony and Samyang. 
* The lens feels like high-quality metal. Feels like a CINE lens in the hands instead of the high-quality plastics in the other ones. 
* First experience, I loved the colours and sharpness.

I’m running into a problem with sharpness in my astrophotos and can’t really figure out what’s going wrong. Maybe someone here has had a similar issue. For me it does not look very sharp and I think there is a way to get better results. 

Example Picture I Took yesterday:
Camera on Tri-Pod, Interval-Series, Samyang 24mm, ISO-2500, F2.0, 15“, 0ev

Setup: Sony A7 IV + Samyang 24mm 1.8 FE.
When focusing manually, I zoom in about 11x on a bright star. What I notice is:
•	The star in the viewfinder never looks clear

•	It shifts from a fuzzy white dot to a more colored dot (slightly red/blue), which then looks sharper than anything else.

•	For my sample shot, the focus indicator was around 11 m. If I set it all the way to “infinity,” the image gets even softer.

The sample was a single shot, but even with stacked frames (including dark frames), sharpness doesn’t really improve – everything still looks a bit mushy.

My questions:
	•	Is this a common issue with the Samyang 24mm 1.8 FE?
	•	Would I get better results with the Sony SEL2470 Zeiss (which I also have available)?
	•	Or is this more likely just a problem with my focusing technique?

Any tips or experiences would be super helpful – maybe I’m missing something obvious.

I have recently been looking at longer focal lengths and zooms. I was unsatisfied by what I found in terms of weight and price and thought to look at other systems. That led me to buying a Sony A7R IV at a good price, as well as the Tamron 70-180 2.8, which is under 2 pounds, stabilized, and compact for only $1,000. Well, I found myself dissatisfied with that setup too and would like to offer my thoughts.

Firstly, I noticed the ergonomic differences when handling an A7iii in store before buying. The A7's are too small. The grip is not deep, and contours in a way that makes it painfully dig into my middle finger. The viewfinder pad is shallow, so much so that my nose bumps into the screen when composing. Oh, and the screen does not flip around for you to see various angles. **You could not watch yourself in this camera.** The AF directional pad is positioned awkwardly center such that it is not naturally under the thumb when holding. Probably one of the worst parts though, and I see this on every other camera brand, is the plastic front dial sticking out of the grip. The back dial on the A7R is exclusively for exposure compensation, which I don't use. I have my S5ii set up for shutter speed there, and ISO on the large d-pad dial. It works perfectly.

The Lumix, judging by photos compared to other brands, I think has the best ergonomics, especially with the dial around the shutter button (some have a power switch there for you to conveniently disastrously flip on accident). I think the only downside besides faster autofocus I would find is that the S5ii's drive mode is set to the left dial, which is not easily accessible to change. HOWEVER, you can actually program any function button to bring up overlay settings once in one of them. This is workable, but I don't understand why they would force it to be this way. In all, the customizability and layout of buttons makes this camera easy to adjust comfortably.

One of the more killer gripes I had with the Sony though was its shooting operation. Despite not being compared in online reviews, this camera uses mechanical shutter, and it's loud. Sounds like a DSLR, and there is no rewarding feel like the Lumix's sounds. I found the auto white balance to be not good, and the colors to be much worse. Worst of all, though, was the viewfinder. Despite being touted as a higher resolution, the display looked very different from the Lumix. What I saw in there looked bad and not like the resulting photo. The photos look normal, in that light-catching soft way. The viewfinder displayed a rather crappy looking footage with odd edges like a video game. I don't know much about this and am curious to try other brands now to see. Somehow, it goes completely unmentioned.

In all, I guess I didn't know how good I had it right off the bat. I will be returning the Sony due to all these ergonomic and in-camera quality monitoring downgrades. I really do not understand how the Lumix is designed and feels SO much better despite having 5% of the market share. I know that this camera is 4 years younger the Sony I tried, but there were so many differences that to this day I imagine are the same in newer models. As a takeaway, my #1 wish here is to draw attention to what I see as a massive need in L Mount, and even Canon lenses. **That 70-180 2.8, 1.75 lb, $1000 stabilized lens was so attractive that I would've switched if the cameras were equivalent.** There is no reason to me that L Mount can't have this configuration; I feel that it should obviously be the standard in the industry as it is so much lighter and inexpensive and accessible. I will be making a separate post asking others to request it from Lumix and other manufacturers like Samyang.",,selftext,Lumix,VibrantPhotos,7,7,1.0,13,False,False,True,False,,,L-Mount,self.Lumix,1759080681.0,2025-09-28T17:31:21+00:00

Analysts attribute the surge to growing expectations surrounding collaborations such as the Netflix animation \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim, once the leader in South Korea’s domestic ramen market, lost its position as the top ramen stock to Samyang Foods in May last year. While Nongshim’s stock price saw little movement, Samyang Foods’ shares soared, driven by its Buldak Ramen. At the shareholders’ meeting in March, complaints erupted: “A company’s competitiveness lies in its market capitalization, and Nongshim is lacking.”

Nongshim’s sluggish stock price began to rebound, riding on the popularity of \*KPop Demon Hunters\*. Reactions continued that the cup ramen and snacks featured in the series reminded viewers of Shin Ramyun and Shrimp Crackers. Nongshim confirmed the collaboration with Netflix, releasing limited-edition products featuring characters from \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim plans to sustain this momentum. The company has set specific targets: achieving sales of 7.3 trillion Korean won and an operating profit margin of 10% by 2030. It also aims to expand overseas sales to 61% of total revenue.

Nongshim has partnered with Netflix to release a product featuring characters from 'KPop Demon Hunters'. /Courtesy of Nongshim

I currently do not own any cameras but I want to learn astrophotograpy. I am planning to get a used DSLR and invest in a good lens, intervelometer and tripod. I am from India.

My plan is to get a **used canon DSLR and get Samyang 135mm f/2.0 lens.**

  
My options for DSLR are:

1. **Canon eos 6d (only camera)** : 9 years old, 11k shutter count for 290 usd (25,000 inr)

2. **Canon eos 200d (camera + kit lenses + SD card)** : 2 years old, 5k shutter count for 431 usd (38,000 inr)

My question is, is it worth the risk to get really old camera (which is well maintained according to seller) for that full frame sensor which I have heard performs great for astro. or go by the safe route and get the newer but APSC camera? 

 Please help me decide between these. Any other recommendations about camera? 

Thank you.",,selftext,AskAstrophotography,IshanGayal,6,6,1.0,7,False,False,True,False,,,Advice,self.AskAstrophotography,1757513436.0,2025-09-10T14:10:36+00:00

I want to use the Sony A6000 we already have and only plan to invest in *one* lens to make it my everyday carry.

Since I'm only purchasing one lens, I'm okay with it being *slightly* pricier for a more versatile lens that fits my needs as much as possible.

Some things I highly value:

* Everday convenience, so compact, lightweight, ideally pocketable or something I can fit in my very small backpack
* Ideally, lens weight target less than 120g and length when retracted is 45mm or less

My use for the camera:

* Photos and videos of everyday lifestyle/travel
* Solo travel (so selfies too)
* Nature/scenery
* Home videos and vlogs while travelling
* Photos of our dog and cat - both very fast and agile so I'm guessing fast and reliable AF?
* Mostly daytime/normal lighting and photos/videos in low light settings too (e.g. night scenery/walks, night markets, dimly lit restaurants, etc.)
* I'll likely shoot *almost* equal amounts of photos and videos (short videos, not long vlog type) so I think lens stabilisation would be important(?)

Other thoughts:

* Zoom preferred for versatility but not essential as we already have the kit zoom lens
* I did research as best as I could (I know nothing about cameras) and the Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS seems to be the closest/only fit
* I saw the Samyang 24mm f/2.8 AF, but there's no OSS, and from what I've read, I would benefit more with OSS?

Some questions:

1. Is there any reason why I should not get the Sony E 35mm f/1.8?
2. Are there are any other lenses that I should consider that would better suit me?
3. I'm considering purchasing an Olympus TG-7 for wet/rainy travel at the end of the year. Would having the A6000 + the lens I end up buying compliment the TG-7 or would this be a redundant purchase? (I know this question is personal preference, but curious what others think)

I’ve been asked to take some photos at a live music concert by a friend who’s in the band. I enjoy photography but I’m an average amateur at best and tend to take some street style shots but mostly photos of the family and days out.

I’ve got a trusty Oly E-M1 that I got from my wife as a wedding present, 11 years ago this Friday and I love it but I’ve never really taken any low light photos. I don’t want to take a load of photos at the gig and find out when I get home that they’re too noisy to use/print. From what I’ve read in the past, bumping the ISO too high might be the camera’s Achilles heel.

I’ll be using an Oly 25mm 1.8 and the 12-40mm 2.8. I also have a Lumix 45-200mm and a Samyang 7.5mm fisheye lens but I doubt these will get used much if at all.

My question is, does anyone know what is a realistic upper limit for the ISO with my kit? The gig is this weekend and I don’t really have time for testing, I’ve never been to the venue before and I don’t think I’ll be able to check the quality by chimping at the gig so I thought I’d ask some fellow M43ers!

I've been doing some non-scientific tests last month because... Well, I have too many lenses that do almost the same thing and I need to sell the ones I'm not using. (There's no more space in the cabinet!)

Then, I thought I would share the results with all of you, so that if you need to make a decision on these lenses, you can check out my results!

Sorry in advance for censoring some stuff in the pics - It's the view from my window and I'd like some privacy 😉

These are the lenses that are part of this test:

* Sony FE 35mm F1.4 G Master
* Sony FE 35mm F2.8 ZA
* Samyang AF 35mm F1.8
* Sigma 40mm F1.4 DG HSM Art (using the MC-11 adapter)
* Bonus: 7 Artisans 35mm F1.4

The camera used is: Sony A7R III

Lightroom presets: manual WB. Then, for all lenses except the TTArtisans - lens automatic corrections fully enabled (also because the Sony looks horrible without it), automatic removal of chromatic aberration was also enabled.

Here is the link to see the pics: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAyXi\_hHmO9htR75zm6ouC70\_1xH2Maw?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAyXi_hHmO9htR75zm6ouC70_1xH2Maw?usp=sharing)

And here are my opinions:

**Sony FE 35mm F2.8 ZA**

Pros:

* Small, light, and cute, can almost fit in my pocket
* 2.8 is a good aperture for such a small lens
* Becomes even more quirky if you install that lens hood from Haoge

Cons:

* Not very sharp, sorry Zeiss fans :(
* Slow AF
* The f\*\*\*ing black paint falls off just by looking at it. Same problem I have with the 55mm 1.8 ZA. Never buy one new or in excellent conditions, it will make you angry!

**Samyang AF 35mm F1.8**

Pros:

* Small and lightweight (but not cute)
* 1.8, it's a good aperture

Cons:

* Probably lets in less light than it should - see shutter speeds in my pictures
* Not as sharp as I was expecting when closing the aperture
* Fringing stays with you at all apertures 🤗 it never lets go!
* Feels always like it's about to break. Does not feel tightly assembled at all.

**Sony FE 35mm F1.4 G Master**

Pros:

* Tack sharp at all apertures, even F1.4
* Very light for being a 1.4 lens
* Fringing goes away when you close the aperture (AS IT SHOULD!!)
* Fast AF

Cons:

* Not as sexy looking as its Sigma competition, and the Haoge hood did not help.

**Sigma 40mm F1.4 DG HSM Art (using the MC-11 adapter)**

Pros:

* Tack sharp starting at 2.8, just very good at 1.4
* Controls fringing so well at all apertures including 1.4, despite not being apochromatic
* 40mm is a pretty good focal length, works very well for me to be honest

Cons:

* MEGA big, MEGA heavy. Definitely not a travel lens.
* Average AF speed
* Despite the camera and the adapter and the lens being with the latest firmware, the AF is not precise and can completely miss near infinity focus. However, zooming in and then hitting AF works.

**7 Artisans 35mm F1.4 (Bonus)**

Pros:

* Super blurry bokeh (probably due to an extreme focus field curvature) and quirky flare will make your portraits with this lens very special
* Unexpectedly sharp in the middle of the image. Closing down makes this clarity circle wider and wider (but you lose in bokeh)
* Very small and portable for being a 1.4 lens
* Lets in more light than the Samyang at comparable apertures... lol

Cons:

* Not sharp at all at the borders - could also be due to extreme focus field curvature
* Kinda heavy for its physical size, but still quite portable
* No AF at all, but the controls are very smooth

**My final notes**

Well well... This is how the story goes:

The 7 Artisans was my first 35mm prime for Sony.

Then I bought the 40mm Sigma.

Then I bought the 35mm 2.8 because small is good.

Then I bought the Samyang 1.8 because 1.8 should be good but it's actually crap on this lens.

Then I bought the GM to see if maybe I could sell both the Samyang and the Sigma, buuuut... Guys I was so disappointed to see that the Sigma 40mm still rules above them all when it comes to chromatic aberrations.

So I will be selling the Samyang and a Sony 24-105 to recoup some of the money I spent on the GM.

I am just wondering if it makes sense for me to keep the 2.8 ZA... It performs ok on my other 24MP Sony A7, so I may keep it for low profile ultra-portable photography...",,title|selftext,SonyAlpha,El_Reddaio,5,5,0.78,2,False,False,True,False,,,Gear,self.SonyAlpha,1758044668.0,2025-09-16T17:44:28+00:00

I’m diving into the world of filmmaking/cinematography — starting out with ads for brands and commercials, with the bigger goal of eventually moving into films. I’m not a total beginner (I’ve used multiple cameras before), but this will be my first time owning my own gear, so I really want to make a well-informed choice.

**Budget:** around **$1800**

Here are the options I’m torn between:

1. **Sony ZV-E10 Mark I vs. Mark II**
   * The Mark II offers **10-bit color**, which feels more future-proof.
2. **Second-hand Sony A7 III**
   * I can get one for the same price as a new ZV-E10 Mark I, but it doesn’t have 10-bit.
3. **Do I actually need 10-bit as a student / beginner filmmaker?**
   * If yes, I don’t mind going for the ZV-E10 Mark II.
4. **Lenses (the part I’m most confused about 😅):**
   * APS-C: Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8, Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8, or Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8
   * Full-frame: Samyang 24-70mm f/2.8 (which I can pair with the A7 III, and surprisingly, some of these full-frame lenses are cheaper than APS-C ones!)
   * Apsc primes?
   * or Full Frame primes that i can use it on apsc body too ( for future proofing )

So my big question is: **Should I build around APS-C and upgrade later, or just invest in full-frame lenses right now for future-proofing?**

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who’ve been in this situation.

I am using an additional laser pointer to rough calibration to the north star and then fine refinement). I also got a tripod ball-head SkyTracker and tripod both genuine from iOptron.

As for the lenses, I am using a Nikon 35mm f/1.8 DX as a working horse for the wide photo and a Nikon AS-P 70-300mm f/4.5-6.3G ED for zoom. I also have the standard 18-55 mm [https://ibb.co/dJ06gGLr](https://ibb.co/dJ06gGLr)  

I usually do 60–100 subs around 90s at 5.6 and ISO 800 (I am targeting M31 now) and stack them in DeepSkyStacker. I’ve also been experimenting with calibration frames,  darks, bias and flats, though I’m still learning how much difference they make and how best to organize them if I shoot over multiple nights. Processing is still rough, not sure that DSS is the best tool (also read about Siril, but haven´t figured our how to work with staks, and then post-process it mostly RawTherapee (Photoshop feels more challenging).

I’m in Southern Germany in an under 100k hab (about Bortle 4-5, brightness around 0.852 mcd/m^(2) and around us it is more like <0.500), so light pollution should in principle be an issue, but from my balcony the sky feels incredible clean. I just ordered Samyang 135mm f/2 that everyone seems to love (but I am not sure if it will worth it for 450 euro) and eventually could save up a bit to get a Optolong L-Pro 77 mm filter as well (by now the whole set is already almost 1700 euro). I got the lenses with two filters, Walimex pro slim MC UV 52mm and Hoya HMC UV(C) 58 mm, but as far as I understand these are pointless for the night photo. 

Right now my main interests are bright galaxies (especially M31) and clusters, but eventually I’d love to move on to emission nebulae eventually. I’m still figuring out the balance between focal length, exposure length, and the limitations of my tracker and I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who’s used similar gear. What would you prioritize at this stage? More integration time, better post-processing practice or keeping upgrading my gear with a filter or some lens in particular? 

The result: [https://ibb.co/twqwKDx1](https://ibb.co/twqwKDx1) (this is direct output from the DSS). ISO 800, total time 200 min, f/5.6 and 200mm.

and this is after my post-processing in RawTerapee: [https://ibb.co/LdHymnsn](https://ibb.co/LdHymnsn) (still kind of worse compared to raw output from DSS). 

Better results with the moon the other night: [https://ibb.co/HL5mcgBw](https://ibb.co/HL5mcgBw) (1/25s, ISO 100, f/7.1, 300mm, single shot).

Specifically, my setup consists of a Samyang 135 and a ZWO 585MC Pro. The problem is that it's a Samyang with a Sony mount, and therefore incompatible with the use of a filter because the backfocus won't be respected. So I bought a 3D adapter by removing the original extension tube. So now I have no problems, I can use everything normally, and it works great. Except that I'm completely unable to do plate solving, whether on Siril or Pixinsight.

Siril: ""The image could not be aligned with the reference stars.""

I installed all the star databases, Gaia, etc.... the pixel size is correct...

Do you have any idea how to fix this? Because it's blocking part of my workflow, especially for Hargb.

After a few weeks of internal debating, I finally decided to upgrade my Nikon D5100 to something newer. I went with the Nikon Z5II, mainly because of the EXPEED 7 processor and its highly praised autofocus. Unfortunately, none of my local stores had a good kit available, so I ended up ordering the body separately along with the Nikkor Z 24-120mm f/4 S. Compared to my previous setup, this combination feels a bit heavy, but it fits my hands really well, which is great.

Right now, I’m looking for some good advice on where to start (besides reading a 1000-page manual, of course), how to properly take care of this camera, and maybe a few basic tips on settings. Could you also recommend a bag or backpack that can hold the camera along with more than one lens?

In the future, I’m planning to get a 14mm f/2.8 lens (probably Samyang, since Rokinon doesn’t ship to my location) for astrophotography.

Thanks in advance, and have a great day! 😊

That number is even higher than 4.8 trillion won valuation received by K-pop powerhouse HYBE when it went public in 2020. The targeted valuation would place Musinsa on par with Korea Aerospace Industries, which had a market cap of 10.6 trillion won, and just below Buldak ramyeon maker Samyang Foods, whose market cap was 11.2 trillion won as of Wednesday.  
   
“Musinsa is aiming for a 10 trillion won market value before going public,” said a fashion industry insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “It hasn’t finalized which exchange it will list on, but it’s open to several options, including ones in the United States.” The target is more than triple the 3.5 trillion won valuation it received in 2023.   
   
In August, Musinsa — which is 52.35 percent owned by its founder and CEO Cho Man-ho — sent a request for proposal to investment banks to pitch for a role in managing the initial public offering (IPO). Its goal for the IPO is to secure funds to open more stores, both domestically and internationally.     
   
Since its launch in 2001, Musinsa has become a must-visit destination for style-savvy tourists, and has come to be known for its affordable yet cutting-edge streetwear. It has become a prominent name in the industry that have been largely driven by conglomerates like Samsung C&T and LF. Korea's first-ever fashion unicorn, Musinsa now operates in 13 countries and globally attracts over 10.19 million monthly active users.  
   
But despite the rapid growth backed by global investors like Sequoia Capital and KKR private equity, experts generally say the market valuation is bloated considering its current earnings.   
   


Displays on Musinsa platform \[MUSINSA\]

   
**Overvaluation, or untapped potential?**  
In the fiercely competitive industry, Musinsa has successfully transformed from a streetwear community into a leading style platform, expanding into beauty, sports and lifestyle — demonstrating its strength across both online and offline markets.  
   
Its rapid growth has been fueled by strong streetwear sales, the launch of its in-house brand Musinsa Standard and lifestyle brand 29Edition, as well as the acquisition of rivals like 29CM.  
   
Initially capturing the hearts of young men in their late teens to early 20s, Musinsa has since broadened its appeal to women as well as to those in their 30s and 40s with its minimalist and staple-driven style — a shift clearly reflected in its growing earnings.   
   


musinsa earnings

   
Musinsa reported 670.54 billion won in revenue in the first half the year, up 22 percent on-year. It logged 58.86 billion won in operating profit, up 23 percent on-year.  
   
The figures are higher than some traditional fashion giants, like Shinsegae International, which reported 2.37 billion won in operating profit during the same period, down 90 percent due to inventory write-down costs, and Hyundai Home Shopping’s Handsome, which reported 22.52 billion won in operating profit, up 3.1 percent.  
   
Despite its rapid growth and strong potential for further expansion, many believe Musinsa’s desired market valuation is overhyped.  
   
“Based on last year’s net profit, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 143 times,” according to Oh Li-na, an analyst at LS Securities. “Even accounting for the second half being the peak season in the fashion industry, the ratio based on this year’s expected annual earnings remains above 100 times. This is unusually high — something that may be seen only in some coin companies — and is difficult to justify.”  
   
The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of a company’s earnings, with high ratio indicating possible overvaluation and the low ratio suggesting possible undervaluation of the company.  
   


Beauty products of Oddtype, Musinsa's store brand \[MUSINSA\]

   
**Aggressive expansion**  
To convince potential investors of its targeted 10 trillion won market valuation, Musinsa is aggressively expanding both domestically and globally to demonstrate strong growth momentum, as increased revenue can help a company secure a favorable valuation ahead of an IPO.  
   
On top of offering an online Musinsa Global Store in the operating countries, the company established Musinsa Japan in 2021. It also formed a joint venture — Musinsa China — with Anta Sports, China’s largest sportswear company, in August. Japan and China are currently Musinsa’s most important overseas markets.  
   
But its overseas performance remains minimal, with exports accounting for just 0.34 percent of its 1.24 trillion won revenue last year. The company attributed the weak export figure to the way commission revenue from partner brand sales on the Musinsa Global Store is calculated, as these transactions are classified as domestic.  
   
Musinsa is also expanding domestically, launching cosmetics brands like Oddtype, and opening more stores.  
   
Musinsa plans to operate 30 Musinsa Standard stores by the end of this year, up from 19 last year. In the first half of next year, it will also open its largest retail space to date — the so-called Musinsa Mega Store Seongsu — a 2,000-pyeong (6,611-square-meter) store that will offer fashion, beauty, footwear and food and beverage products.  
   
The aggressive expansion and diversification of product categories reflects Musinsa’s broader strategy to boost revenue and enhance its overall market valuation.  
   
Company valuation is typically assessed using metrics like the P/E ratio or price-to-sales ratio — the latter calculated as market capitalization divided by total revenue — which means that higher revenue can be advantageous for companies aiming to justify a higher valuation.  
   
Though overpriced, Musinsa may still become Korea’s next member of the 10 trillion won club. If so, they would follow in the footsteps of Samyang Foods, whose stock has surged more than 15-fold over the past five years, and cosmetics company APR, who saw share prices jump more than three times within just a year and a half since its IPO in February last year.  
   
“K-fashion isn’t visibly taking off overseas yet, but the market is pricing in the hope that Musinsa could follow a similar path to Samyang Foods and APR, whose shares skyrocketed,” said Seo Yong-gu, a professor of business at Sookmyung Women’s University.

The 18-110 is basically parfocal with minimal focus breathing, while the 18-105 lacks its pro features such as long focus throw, pull focus, zooming capabilities, etc.

However, the price difference between the two is $1000, which is pretty steep giving they basically cover the same focal range and have same aperture speed.

Wondering if I should go ahead with the 18-110 F4 to future proof myself for pro work on docs, etc, or use the extra money to grab a viewfinder, tilta rig, etc for Sony FS7. I currently have the FS7 LCD screen and grip, mics, lights, tripod, and all other basics for video, just lacking the items mentioned above, for context. Really want the 18-110 cause I like to have gear respected and capable on a professional level, but also want to be economical.

I plan to use a FS7/FX30 combo and already have several prime photo lenses (Sigma 16mm 1.4 APSC, Samyang 18mm 1.4 FF, Tamron 35 2.8 FF, Samyang 50mm 1.4 FF, Viltrox 85mm 1.8 FF, Samyang 135mm 1.8 FF), but no zooms other than the kit lenses that came with Sony A6400.

I am a student in the astronomy club of my College with deep interest in Astrophotography.   
Now that tenure of our seniors is over the club has been handed to us to manage. We decided to draft a proposal to buy Cameras for astrophotography as there was only a besser Camera in the club room.  
We have a 8 inch Celestron dobsonian, a 12 inch Celestron Dobsonian  
2 Equatorial Mounts. One of them being C26-CEM26 iOptron mount (I don't know the model of the other mount). And a maksutov cassigrain telescope Celestron Nexstar 127 SLT (We use it with the iOptron mount).  


Now comes the Proposal part. We made a proposal consisting only of Sony Mirrorless Cameras (a7 iii. a7r iii, a7c iii) as they seemed versatile, with Samyang 135 mm f/2 lens, and a tamron 70-300 mm lens f/4-5.6, Also it included 28-70 mm kit lens  
I didn't include the dedicated cameras as they seemed to be a bit hefty to setup, also the club members are kind of not willing to have that kind of Learning curve with dedicated Astro cameras (I don't mind but gotta take opinions from everyone).   
We drafted the proposal but our Faculty mentor rejected it and told us to buy Astro Dedicated Camera   
he suggested ASI533MC pro.  
Now I want to get all of yours experienced opinion on the matter of what should we do, try to negotiate for the Mirrorless or get the ASI533MC Pro.   
As for me I am kind of confused between both, Because Mirrorless Cameras offer more versatility, We can even use it to have a coverage of the events club conducts, do wide field milky way shots, and get a wide field where lots of DSOs are visible, but i am equally enticed by the great zoomed pictures we can click with dedicated Astro camera",,selftext,AskAstrophotography,DamnJerry123,2,2,1.0,5,False,False,True,False,,,Equipment,self.AskAstrophotography,1756827808.0,2025-09-02T15:43:28+00:00

I bought a gimbal so that I could start making (better) video content, but the lens and camera body is on the cusp for the weight limit of the gimbal and balancing is arduous.

The top three things I do with the current set up is  
1. Photos mostly of people  
2. Interviews/monologues (tripod)  
3. B-roll <---- this is what I need the lens to do well (current projects is creating adverts for a private health clinic and laser eye clinic.)

Using chat GPT I got the following recommendations  
**1. Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 G2**  
**2. Sony 20-70mm f/4 G**  
**3. Sony 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS**  
**4. Sony 35mm f/1.8**

The Samyang is worth around £500-700. So that's essentially my budget. 

Would it be better to buy two lenses with different focal lengths or one all rounder?  
Are any of the ones on my list any good?  
What would you recommend?

So I also purchase Megadap ETZ21 Pro Plus which is newest one and it is only adapter with weather sealing and wide compatibility list.

First, and most disturbing issue is that it does not properly control lens power.

First boot : ""Viltrox"" logo on LCD, disappear after setting times (mine set to 0.5sec) - delay approx. 1 second - logo appear again, still lens not working, wait 4 to 5 seconds, then it start work.

Wake up from sleep mode : exactly same process as first boot again. This is serious problem because, when I need shot, press half release shutter in order to wake my camera up, lens not responding for 5 to 6 second, I lost chance to make a shot. Many times. So I've disabled sleep feature of my camera, then reboot problem is disappear of course, but now battery drains dramatically...

With native mount i.e Sony, first boot and wake up from sleep mode both finish less than 1 sec.

With Viltrox E-Z adapter, has no power lost and boot problem but slightly slower than with Sony. But I did not choose this because there is no weather sealing.

This particular problem, I and Megadap distributor both ask to their support center, and the answer was:

**""Currently, the brands has compatibility issues with our Megadap ETZ21 Pro+ model are Viltrox and Samyang. In our opinion, protocols of Viltrox and Samyang are not sufficiently complete to be fully compatible with our adapter. Unless these brands do some updates or upgrade their protocol, there is nothing we can do about it. Recent Samyang lenses works fine though, however still some older lenses may not.""**

[This is working video of wake up problem, first boot\(when camera power on\) also exactly same like this.](https://reddit.com/link/1nqsk67/video/jhbwmc84yfrf1/player)

This is disturbing answer indeed. While I wait Viltrox Z-mount version 35mm f1.2 LAB, I have to use this FE lens with problem all the time...

Second, Viltrox 35mm f1.2's minimum aperture 1.2 shows on camera screen and saved metadata(EXIF) as 1.1. This problem exist on Megadap, Neewer and Viltrox E-Z adapter as well. So I am strongly doubt about firmware completeness as Megadap support center said...

I have recently changed camera from a Canon 700D with a Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC USD, to a SonyA7iii.
This is a pretty significant upgrade as you know, the canon served me well despite it being a mega budget camera, but it was time for something better.
got my new A/ili with a budget lens, a Sony FE 50mm f/1.8. First day with it though I hated it. Really struggled with AF, couldn't get it sharp. So I contacted MPB and upgraded (slightly) to a Samyang AF 50mm f/1.4 - Sony FE Fit.
I know this is another budget lens, so maybe I am to blame (trying to upgrade slowly as this hobby isn't a cheap one), but I hated this one too. Same issue with focus and image quality.
Now I'm thinking these lenses are not doing the body justice, and it's that, rather than my camera settings themselves that are to blame.
I'm thinking of grabbing either:
Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD - Sony FE Fit as this was a recommendation from a wedding photographer friend.
Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III RXD - Sony FE fit as this mimics my old lens on my Canon
Tamron 28-200mm f/2.8-5.6 Di III RXD - Sony FE Fit because wow the range.
Or any others you may recommend
For context, I am not focused on one particular use case for photography. I do friends weddings, landscapes, portraits, so I want something versatile and I don't mind travelling with heavy gear.

Any advice would be mega, thank you!

I want to use the Sony A6000 we already have and only plan to invest in *one* lens to make it my everyday carry.

Since I'm only purchasing one lens, I'm okay with it being *slightly* pricier for a more versatile lens that fits my needs as much as possible.

Some things I highly value:

* Everday convenience, so compact, lightweight, ideally pocketable or something I can fit in my very small backpack
* Ideally, lens weight target less than 120g and length when retracted is 45mm or less

My use for the camera:

* Photos and videos of everyday lifestyle/travel
* Solo travel (so selfies too)
* Nature/scenery
* Home videos and vlogs while travelling
* Photos of our dog and cat - both very fast and agile so I'm guessing fast and reliable AF?
* Mostly daytime/normal lighting and photos/videos in low light settings too (e.g. night scenery/walks, night markets, dimly lit restaurants, etc.)
* I'll likely shoot *almost* equal amounts of photos and videos (short videos, not long vlog type) so I think lens stabilisation would be important(?)

Other thoughts:

* Zoom preferred for versatility but not essential as we already have the kit zoom lens
* I did research as best as I could (I know nothing about cameras) and the Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS seems to be the closest/only fit
* I saw the Samyang 24mm f/2.8 AF, but there's no OSS, and from what I've read, I would benefit more with OSS?

Some questions:

1. Is there any reason why I should not get the Sony E 35mm f/1.8?
2. Are there are any other lenses that I should consider that would better suit me?
3. I'm considering purchasing an Olympus TG-7 for wet/rainy travel at the end of the year. Would having the A6000 + the lens I end up buying compliment the TG-7 or would this be a redundant purchase? (I know this question is personal preference, but curious what others think)

I’m currently shooting an a6700 with either a Tamron 28-200 f2.8-5.6 or Sony E 35mm f1.8 OSS. My shooting is mainly linked to bikepacking or cycle touring, snowboarding and hiking but I’m starting to use it more at cycling events and weddings/family events. This is all for personal use, not paid so no need to upgrade to a dual card body. Various requirements that I’m looking for:
- Due to the outdoors nature of what I do I need good levels of weather protection that I’m finding the Sony 35 doesn’t offer. Weather sealing is an absolute must.
- Nothing too heavy/bulky. The Tamron is a bit large, but I’ve managed to carry it across my back all day for a 2month tour with only a bit of an ache by the end.
- For bigger trips I will probably still carry the Tamron for its adaptability when travelling, but sometimes want something a little bit more lightweight for short trips or cycling events with a lot of elevation gain. This is generally where I reach for the 35mm.
- With the events, I’m starting to see myself shooting more into the evenings when riders tend to come together. Therefore I’m tempted by a good low light lens. A fast prime of f1.4 seems attractive.
- 35mm (50mm equiv.) is sometimes perfect in terms of focal length, sometimes a bit too tight, so willing to look at something round the 20-30mm lens range.
- Budget is to be defined based on what options offer the right mix. I’ll be shopping used on whatever I find.
- Absolute perfection in image quality is not a must as I’m more using the photos to build and backup a story, rather than relying solely on the image. I’m no pixel peeper.

So far I can see various merits with these ones, but wondering if anyone can comment or make other suggestions:
- Sigma 23mm f1.4 DC DN C - Lightweight, right focal range, fast aperture, but only weather sealing is at the mount.
- Samyang AF 24mm f1.8 - Lightweight, weather sealed but at only f1.8 I feel it doesn’t offer much over my current 35mm. Also I’ve seen reports of firmware issues with the a6700 which means possibly needing to get the Lens Station to update (as I’ll be buying 2nd hand lens).
- Sony 24mm f1.4 GM ii - (Yes, yes I know it’s a FF lens) - Weather sealed, fast, light enough, right focal range, but pricier.
- Sony E 15mm f1.4 G - weather sealed, fast, light, but unsure if I’d want to go that wide after being used to the 35. One to go and try out in store maybe.

Any other ideas ?

Hello,

I have got a manual focus Samyang 14mm f/2.8 ED AS IF UMC lens, and I was told that it comes with AE Chip (from stock).

However, neither I can see any contacts on the back of the lens nor focus guide is working with my Canon 6d. So my question is, how does the lens with AE chip communicate to the camera? I would assume that via the contacts, but there is none. So, assuming that the contacts are needed, I either need an adapter? or my lens does not have a chip?

Also I understood, that some people install the chip or an adapter with  chip and contacts on the lens that will pass to the camera some info about exp and also facilitate the focus guiding via activating the autofocus within the camera. However, I found on the Samyang website that an aperture control motor and CPU chip is installed within 14mm F2.8 ED AS IF UMC Canon AE lens to assist Auto Exposure(AE) for Canon cameras. The aperture can be controlled from camera body thanks to the motor and chip. Also the appropriate focus is guided with indicator light. So, for some lens it is installed by the Samyang within a body (I assumed that for mine as well) but then is somehow needs to tell camera ""hello"". So, back to the original question. I also assume that adapter is not an option here as the stock version should come out as plug and play.



So, any guidance is much appreciated.



Thank you.

“What % of my skincare is actually worth the money vs. just marketing fluff? Score each product 0–100% ROI based on dermatology research.”

Here’s what it came back with (brace yourselves):

•Origins Cleanser 🧼 — Solid, but cleansers only stay on for 30 seconds. ROI: 30%

•Rose Water Toner 🌹 — Feels nice, but basically vibes. ROI: 15%

•Origins Ginzing Eye Cream 👁️✨ A moisturizer in a smaller jar. ROI: 25%

•Samyang Aqua Cream (day) 💧Good hydration and barrier support. ROI: 70%
	
•Shiseido Sunscreen ☀️🛡️ The GOAT. #1 anti-aging step. ROI: 100%

Current setup: Samyang 35mm f/1.8 + Tamron 28–200mm f/2.8–6.4. I love tele landscape shots and I’m thinking about changing my kit.

My current favorites to buy are the **Tamron 50–300mm (f/4.5–6.3)** for tele landscape work, and maybe the **Tamron 16–30mm f/2–2.8** for wide-angle and low-light/astro shots.

Questions:

* How would the new combo (16–30 f/2–2.8 + 50–300) compare to my current 35mm + 28–200 setup for landscape photography? Better, worse, or about the same?
* Is the 50–300mm a good choice for landscape/tele work (detail and reach) or would another tele option be noticeably better?
* For wide-angle/astrophotography, is a 16–30 f/2–2.8 worth it compared to keeping the 35mm f/1.8 and using the 28–200?
* Any concerns about weight/size for traveling around Australia/NZ with those lenses?
* Any recommend alternatives I should consider that balance tele reach, image quality, and travel-friendliness?

In my research I found Samyang 12mm f/2 is one of the best landscape lens in budget for apsc cameras.

Later I found that there are two lenses. Most of the posts and videos on the internet are about the older - Samyang 12mm f/2 NCS CS lens. there are very few reviews for the newer AF lens.

From spec sheets I found that there is a different coating on the newer AF version unlike the older which has Nano Coating System.
Other than that AF version has 7 aperture blades(older has 6).Older has larger filter threads (67mm), newer has 62mm threads.
Everything else is same on both lenses.

Links for both lenses:

Samaymg 12mm F/2 AF : https://samyangus.com/products/12mm-f2-0-af-compact-ultra-wide-angle-aps-c-sony-e

 I am getting both the lenses at almost the same price. Which one should I buy?

Current setup: Samyang 35mm f/1.8 + Tamron 28–200mm f/2.8–6.4. I love tele landscape shots and I’m thinking about changing my kit.

My current favorites to buy are the **Tamron 50–300mm (f/4.5–6.3)** for tele landscape work, and maybe the **Tamron 16–30mm f/2–2.8** for wide-angle and low-light/astro shots.

Questions:

* How would the new combo (16–30 f/2–2.8 + 50–300) compare to my current 35mm + 28–200 setup for landscape photography? Better, worse, or about the same?
* Is the 50–300mm a good choice for landscape/tele work (detail and reach) or would another tele option be noticeably better?
* For wide-angle/astrophotography, is a 16–30 f/2–2.8 worth it compared to keeping the 35mm f/1.8 and using the 28–200? 
* Any concerns about weight/size for traveling around Australia/NZ with those lenses?
* Any recommend alternatives I should consider that balance tele reach, image quality, and travel-friendliness?
* Budget around 1k

Wandrd? Peak Design?,"I've got a trip to NYC coming up in November and at this point I've mastered the art of one-bag travel but this time I'm bringing camera gear for walking around and that means I need a new bag.

I'm thinking something in the 25-30L range should be enough as for this kind of trip my 20L Evergoods backpack is usually plenty. But I need to stuff a Sony A7CR, Sony 70-200mm f/2.8, Samyang 85mm f/1.4 and Sigma 35mm f/1.2 in it as well.

Right now I'm eyeing the Wandrd Prvke or the Peak Design Everyday Bag. Both are roughly $300-$350 but also the kind of bags you buy once and never replace because they don't die so that's fine.

Is there anything else in that I should be considering? Bonus points if I can save a bit.

My ideal bag can fit my mirrorless plus 2-3 lenses (I almost never need more), plus some cloths and the like. Which is why 30L seems like the sweet spot.

Additional features that I really want but aren't deal breakers are:

1. Being lower profile on my back. I ride a motorcycle and it'd be nice to be able to use this for that as well but anything that stick s up acts like a sail which is a very no go.
2. Weather resistant / waterproof zippers, etc. As I said, motorcycle, plus if I'm carrying camera gear I don't want to have to worry about what happens if it starts to rain so long as I'm not in a monsoon.
3. Camera insert / dividers etc are removable. A 30L bag that I can only use when I'm traveling is way less useful to me than a 30L bag I can use whenever I need more carrying capacity than my standard 20L allows.",,selftext,backpacks,TheOnceAndFutureDoug,1,1,1.0,5,False,False,True,False,,,Question,self.backpacks,1759171956.0,2025-09-29T18:52:36+00:00

I’m diving into the world of filmmaking/cinematography — starting out with ads for brands and commercials, with the bigger goal of eventually moving into films. I’m not a total beginner (I’ve used multiple cameras before), but this will be my first time owning my own gear, so I really want to make a well-informed choice.

**Budget:** around **$1800**

Here are the options I’m torn between:

1. **Sony ZV-E10 Mark I vs. Mark II**
   * The Mark II offers **10-bit color**, which feels more future-proof.
2. **Second-hand Sony A7 III**
   * I can get one for the same price as a new ZV-E10 Mark I, but it doesn’t have 10-bit.
3. **Do I actually need 10-bit as a student / beginner filmmaker?**
   * If yes, I don’t mind going for the ZV-E10 Mark II.
4. **Lenses (the part I’m most confused about 😅):**
   * APS-C: Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8, Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8, or Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8
   * Full-frame: Samyang 24-70mm f/2.8 (which I can pair with the A7 III, and surprisingly, some of these full-frame lenses are cheaper than APS-C ones!)
   * or just APSC prime or Full Frame primes for future proofing( that i would pair with a7iii or zv e10/e10ii )

So my big question is: **Should I build around APS-C and upgrade later, or just invest in full-frame lenses right now for future-proofing?**

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who’ve been in this situation. Thanks so much! 🙏 (btw, I’m a student, so I’m putting all my savings into this setup)",,selftext,videography,AdministrativeCut339,1,1,1.0,0,False,False,True,False,,,Technical/Equipment Help and Information,self.videography,1758046426.0,2025-09-16T18:13:46+00:00

Does anyone know of any good (I.E. Hot-spot free upwards of F8) E-Mount lens with auto-focus?  
Doesn't have to be manufactured by Sony, however I would like to stay native mount.

I’m looking to upgrade my wide-angle lens for astrophotography and I’m debating between two options:
	•	Canon RF 16mm f/2.8 (248€)
	•	Samyang 14mm f/2.8 + EF–RF adapter (300€ + ~90€)

I know the RF 16mm is lighter and native to the mount, but I’ve read mixed opinions about coma and corner sharpness. On the other hand, the Samyang has been a popular budget choice for astrophotography for years, though using the adapter makes the setup a bit bulkier. (But for me there are no problem of space)

For those of you who have tried either (or both), which one would you recommend for astrophotography specifically? Any pros/cons I should consider before deciding?

Thanks a lot!

Its quite comparable to my Samyang 85mm f1.4 - which costs a third, so i‘d expect it to be a lot slower but they are quite similar.

I’m diving into the world of filmmaking/cinematography — starting out with ads for brands and commercials, with the bigger goal of eventually moving into films. I’m not a total beginner (I’ve used multiple cameras before), but this will be my first time owning my own gear, so I really want to make a well-informed choice.

**Budget:** around **$1800**

Here are the options I’m torn between:

1. **Sony ZV-E10 Mark I vs. Mark II**
   * The Mark II offers **10-bit color**, which feels more future-proof.
2. **Second-hand Sony A7 III**
   * I can get one for the same price as a new ZV-E10 Mark I, but it doesn’t have 10-bit.
3. **Do I actually need 10-bit as a student / beginner filmmaker?**
   * If yes, I don’t mind going for the ZV-E10 Mark II.
4. **Lenses (the part I’m most confused about 😅):**
   * APS-C: Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8, Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8, or Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8
   * Full-frame: Samyang 24-70mm f/2.8 (which I can pair with the A7 III, and surprisingly, some of these full-frame lenses are cheaper than APS-C ones!)
   * or just APSC prime or Full Frame primes for future proofing( that i would pair with a7iii or zv e10/e10ii )

So my big question is: **Should I build around APS-C and upgrade later, or just invest in full-frame lenses right now for future-proofing?**

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who’ve been in this situation. Thanks so much! 🙏 (btw, I’m a student, so I’m putting all my savings into this setup)",,selftext,Filmmakers,AdministrativeCut339,0,0,0.5,11,False,False,True,False,,,Question,self.Filmmakers,1758046516.0,2025-09-16T18:15:16+00:00

I sold it with the kit lens (28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS) which was fine but not great. I’m not going to fall into the trap of gear acquisition syndrome, so I’m trying to play my cards carefully here. I’ve walked around with a 55 1.8 for a couple of months but I need a good all-rounder lens, or otherwise a good combination of lenses that don’t make me feel that I need an all-rounder. 

I currently have the Zeiss 55 1.8 (my favourite), a wide angle Sigma 14-24 2.8 (great but less useful), and a Samyang 35 2.8 (meh, hardly use it but good focal length). 

I’d say the type of photography I do the most could be classified as street, but I like taking some abstract shots, some shots of people (either proper portraits or candid), nature/animals. I love a wide aperture, don’t need a massive zoom (just some flexibility). I have a budget of probably up to £1000, but it’s negotiable. I may sell my 35mm, but keep the other two. So realistically I’m looking at covering focal lengths somewhere in the 20 to 100 range, and not necessarily with a single lens. In the future I’d be keen on a longer (macro?) prime for portraits but not immediately. Portability is good but not my priority. 

I’ve uploaded a sample of pictures I’ve taken to give an idea of my style, they’re a bit older so were A7ii or my RX100.

Current setup: Samyang 35mm f/1.8 + Tamron 28–200mm f/2.8–6.4. I love tele landscape shots and I’m thinking about changing my kit.

My current favorites to buy are the **Tamron 50–300mm (f/4.5–6.3)** for tele landscape work, and maybe the **Tamron 16–30mm f/2–2.8** for wide-angle and low-light/astro shots.

Questions:

* How would the new combo (16–30 f/2–2.8 + 50–300) compare to my current 35mm + 28–200 setup for landscape photography? Better, worse, or about the same?
* Is the 50–300mm a good choice for landscape/tele work (detail and reach) or would another tele option be noticeably better?
* For wide-angle/astrophotography, is a 16–30 f/2–2.8 worth it compared to keeping the 35mm f/1.8 and using the 28–200?
* Any concerns about weight/size for traveling around Australia/NZ with those lenses?
* Any recommend alternatives I should consider that balance tele reach, image quality, and travel-friendliness?
* Budget around 1k

I’m moving from my old A7 I with the 28–70 kit lens to the A6700, and I realized I was always shooting around 70mm and sometimes at 45mm – so I lean toward tele/normal rather than wide.

Now I’m stuck between three possible setups:

* **Tamron 17–70 f/2.8** – the obvious all-round travel zoom. Versatile, stabilized, covers almost everything.
* **Viltrox 27mm 1.2 + Viltrox 75mm 1.2** – I love the prime look. I borrowed a prime once and really enjoyed the results. These lenses are chunky, but honestly I like that – they feel great and look amazing.
* **Sigma 18–50 f/2.8 + Sigma 30mm 1.4** – a hybrid setup: flexible zoom for daily/travel shots + a fast prime for low light and shallow depth of field.

I’m also planning to add the **Samyang 13mm f/2.0** for landscapes/astro in Canada (I’ll be documenting a year abroad there).

**My shooting:**

* Street
* Social media / daily life documentation
* Landscapes / travel (esp. Canada)

Here’s my question: I love the idea of those big, heavy 1.2 lenses – they’re just fun and have a beautiful look. I even borrowed one from a friend once for my full-frame camera and loved it. But do I really need to go all-in on f/1.2, or is f/1.4 more than enough in practice?

What would you suggest for my use case – one of these setups, or something completely different? And what do you personally use on your A6700 (or similar)?

I'm looking for advice on choosing a 35mm AF lens for my Sony A7IV. 

**My photography style:**
- Intimate portraits and lifestyle shots
- Dark and moody aesthetics
- Black and white work
- Studio photography

**What I'm looking for:**
- Sharp image quality
- Fast and reliable AF performance
- Nice bokeh character
- Lightweight (definitely not looking for a 1kg monster!)
- Good build quality

**Lenses I've already considered:**
- Sony FE 35mm f/1.8 (but looking for alternatives)
- Samyang AF 35mm f/1.8
- 7artisans AF 35mm f/1.8 (recently released) - I own their 85mm f/1.8 and absolutely love it, so I had high expectations for this one, but the reviews I've seen are quite disappointing

**Budget considerations:**
- Open to Chinese brands (7artisans, Meike, Viltrox, etc.)
- More interested in real-world performance than brand prestige

I'd love to hear about your actual experiences with 35mm lenses on the A7IV, especially for similar photography styles. Has anyone tried the new 7artisans 35mm AF? What are the real-world issues compared to reviews? Any other alternatives I should consider?

Got on a train that was somewhat packed. Was feeling fine. Next stop is 20 minutes away. A few minutes in I have the overwhelming urge to vomit. I 我慢 the shit out of it for the next 15 minutes,  but I soon realize I can’t hold on. 

The way I see it, my options are to swallow the vomit as best I can as it comes up, trying to prevent any of it from coming out, or vomit in the connection between the cars as to least bother other people. I take a peek at the connection, and it looks like it would be really hard to clean up vomit with the ridges from the connection tube and whatnot.

Not an option. 

I just tuck myself as far away from anyone else as I can and try to calm my body down. 

無理. It’s coming. I grab the towel I use to dab sweat away, and cover my mouth, wondering if I should just sacrifice my $200 backpack and its entire contents instead. Then suddenly, faster than a Shinkansen I’m ambushed by last nights dinner and my midnight shin ramen snack. It’s chunky. It’s hot. It’s a bit noodley. 

My cheeks fill up like a balloon. I clench ass and channel bushido. It goes down. I’ve won. But it’s not over, like a Mongol invasion it comes again. Ghenghis Khan assaults my mouth, and it’s not the tasty Hokkaido kind. I see the rising sun flash in my mind. Amaterasu beckons me. It goes down. A final assault comes and I writhe as I see visions of my ancestors. Plus Ultra. It goes down. 

Disaster averted. No news reports of meiwaku gaijin barfing on pristine Japanese trains. If anybody noticed, they didn’t seem to want to show it.
I’ve triumphed, but at what cost?

What was I supposed to have done? Kinda wish they had barf bags on the train. Nobody even had a plastic bag I could ask for. I’m going home

Edit: since many people asked, it was from Hazawa Yokohama to Musashi Kosugi. 17-19 minutes without a stop. Wasn’t motion sickness, I think I had a medication that requires food on an empty stomach, and it caused the reaction.

I don’t know if I have lowered my expectations or if I have accepted the reality of a production that wants to have its pain au chocolat and to eat it too. I can make a case for what was gained in this episode but not without lamenting what we also lost. I guess that’s what I will try to do, at the risk of contradicting myself. Which is ironic, because this is the issue with the show itself: trying to hold the original love story in tandem with this newer and, I think, very seductive story arc of Belly on her own.

I want to start by saying this episode was the satisfying winding up of a million plot points, which it did efficiently and successfully, and in showing viewers outcomes rather than telling. Jere’s ongoing need to ‘hook up’ with people in his attempts to dampen his inflamed self-esteem issues was firmly on display as were the reactions of the two people he upset by doing this. This, combined with his inability to go inside the Cousins house at Christmas, fully showed the long-lasting reverberations of the break up for each brother. Far more, I would posit, than for Belly herself, since both Conrad and Jeremiah are happy to initiate and/or have some contact with her but not each other. Though steps towards repairing relationships are taken, they are fragile and faltering.  There is no quick fix. We see the permanent damage to long term friendships between Steven and Conrad but more significantly between the Fisher brothers. 

As a result, the episode felt agile in its storytelling, and pacing was quite successful. The flash-forwards through the seasons worked beautifully, as did the use of Conrad’s voice in his letters to narrate Belly’s Parisian montages—a clever device evoking the telephone conversations the pair have in Season 2, Conrad wonders if his letters, like his phone calls before them, “are even allowed.”

Healing is clearly a central theme: time, space, and the capacity to set yourself free—from fear of hurting others, of being hurt, or through the act of forgiveness (thanks Denise). Even through the poignant act of letting go. When Jere finally calls Belly on New Year’s Eve because he is “sick of being too scared to talk to her,” it is not without symbolism that this conversation ends with Belly saying, “I should probably let you go,” and Jeremiah replying, “I should probably let you go too.” Spoiler: they aren’t just talking about the phone.

Speaking of healing, according to Taylor, Sexy Latino Chalamet rebounds are apparently all just part of that. Enter stage left, Benito, who is thankfully left as a sketch, defined somewhat ironically by some awful cliché about beauty and emptiness, since he appears to be a photographer? There is also one horribly trite moment of quoting a single enigmatic line from Pablo Neruda: “I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.” Perhaps odd in the context of a show supposedly about infinite love and an unbreakable connection, but probably a fitting level of detail for someone who appears to have no other qualities Belly might be attracted to—other than that he is there. Lucky for him, we know proximity for Belly is everything, but god help him, he’s about to take an ill-timed trip to visit his grandma!

Alert, Benito, Alert! Maybe consider sending your Abuela a card instead? Conrad Fisher in cornflower blue merino is boarding a plane. Not quite Yves Klein but definitely Matisse. With an agenda, Agnes having pushed him to the extreme edge of his risk profile by suggesting, in my favourite line of the episode, “Doctor, help thyself.” Indeed, as per flight safety 101 those assisting others must first ensure their own well-being.

Conrad and Jere slugging it out in the cemetery felt like the fandom’s arguments playing out in real time. It wasn’t dissatisfying to hear Conrad sigh, half exasperated, “You can’t take someone, Jere—she isn’t a fucking object,” or to hear Jeremiah admit that he knew, as soon as he brought up Christmas, it would be over. This is an acknowledgment that, on some level, Conrad was right in saying the marriage couldn’t preserve what was already beginning to crumble, even if he was the catalyst after all. If only the audience had been given clearer signs of this beyond the blind co-dependency angle. Every part of me cheered when Jere finally admitted that he could never really compete with the bond shared between Belly and Conrad, and that something like that shouldn’t be wasted. This was somewhat dampened by my realisation that there was little or jo evidence of such a bond from Belly’s perspective for nearly the entire duration of Season 3.

Speaking of Jellies, credit where credit’s due. They were really onto something when they came for the Bonrads over the assertion Jere can’t cook. Clearly it’s Belly who has the basic culinary skills and palate. I take it all back—Jere is not responsible for the Shin Ramen. The little detail of her cooking stuffing and then noting that it was better last year was a good way of continuing to show not tell that Jere’s a whiz in the kitchen, and that it is an area in which Conrad, with his under-seasoned chicken, has never been able to compete, with Jere’s amazing sandwich history neatly alluded to at the first Thanksgiving in Ep 5, S2.

It *almost* redeems Jere of his fussiness over the wedding cake. From gochujang carrots that would even make Halmoni swoon to his irritation at Taylor over the potato ricer at Friendsgiving, it seems laid-back Jeremiah is not all that laid back at all when something that is not Belly finally matters to him. You can see exactly where this is headed: Jere will become an accomplished chef, his first lauded dessert will be a Cereal Milk Panna Cotta with Cornflake Praline & Malted Milk Foam.

From those details that suggest future pathways, the episode then turns to the details that echo their pasts. A million tiny reverberations—Susannah, whose epitaph tells us she loved fiercely and always found herself by the sea; the line from the e.e. cummings poem in the first edition gifted to Belly by Laurel on her 16th birthday. The same is true of both Conrad and Jeremiah, who whatever other criticism you  might proffer, loved Belly with that same ferocity, and who need Cousins Beach the way their mother did. The postcard creased in Conrad’s wallet like a tiny piece of hope from the book, the polaroid from that party tucked away in his top drawer—all these fragments reminding us how much of their story is built on memory, sentiment, and the persistence of feeling.

I also appreciated the small details: the cherry dress and red pyjamas still hanging in Belly’s wardrobe (though if there is anyone on earth who puts their pjs on coat hangers can they please step forward) and the bag which says “The sea (or is it C) called,” nestled right next to Junior Mint about to make his first international trip. How about the Sacré Coeur (Sacred Heart) looming in the background as Belly finally writes Conrad back? Significance subtle as a sledgehammer.

Belly is the only one who seems to be free of any problematic residual feelings. The Fisher brothers, as Taylor announces, are last year’s news. Paris looks good on a glowing Belly. She is not afraid of being hurt, but afraid of hurting those around her. Kind of fair, I’d say? I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say, given the collateral damage she’s caused, the idea that Taylor waves her off into the waiting Benito’s arms—where she kisses him with as much enthusiasm as you’d maybe want to leave for your leading man hit another bung note for me. Thankfully I am now so comfortably numb it didn’t do much, but I would like to have seen a more casual relationship between them for a shorter time. No matter, I suspect he will also be jettisoned shortly for the all encompassing independent arc. 

Which is all well and good for a show that is about to have another season, but we have only one episode and a sinking question in our hearts: when is it ever going to be time for Conrad? Remember those pesky books and their original story 7.4 million people got attached to?

And herein lies the problem. The show has snookered itself. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. On the one hand we get Isabel fully happy in her own life, created through grit and determination, having managed through raging homesickness, magically resolved French and all. She just apparently needed the confidence to stop rehearsing the lines to be able to give it back to her flatmates in their native Parisian.
This is a girl who does not need Conrad Fisher, but more problematically perhaps even appears not to want him—yet audiences hope she still loves him all the same. 
There is definitely power in the position of independence for Belly. I call that a gain: if she chooses to love Conrad, in the forcefield-like and incomparable way Jere calls out, she does so on her own terms.

This has all the appeal of presenting an Isabel Conklin who has a place all her own, who unequivocally needs no man to sleep in her bed with her, and has wrestled control of her own story. Problematically, it also holds the contradiction of someone who seems to have almost forgotten Conrad all season for his brother, now finding herself forgetting about him for Paris and Benito too. 

The lack of sentiment over the arrival of Junior Mint and the concealed necklace was jarring, and her throwing herself at Benito moments after declaring the end of an era did nothing to support the idea that this Isabel is right for the forever love ending that waits in Conrad’s arms.

Whatever the case, the end is written clearly enough now for us—in two sets of fonts. If you haven’t worked it out, Belly has chosen Paris, and I would hazard a guess, will choose Paris again as Conrad leaves the city. Suggest an epic run to the train station before her heartfelt confession: “I have loved you since I was ten years old, my whole life, it’s always been you,” followed by the palaver about how she swam out too far and he rescues her. Here’s what she is adding: “but now I need to be myself here, alone, learning to be myself,” or some other platitude to that effect. He will support her, telling her, “We are infinite”. The Sixth Consecutive Summer I Suffered for You? You’ve been born to bleed alright, Little Soldier.

Suspect then, having found “what she wanted” in Paris (herself) and having no further business there beyond her psych studies concluding at the Sorbonne, we see Isabel return to the US—perhaps for a wedding (Laurel and John? Steven and Taylor? Or Adam and Kayleigh). Perhaps it will be she acts on the feeling she describes so beautifully at the beginning of the episode as a sudden wild yearning for home she feels in her bones, for the people who know her. Perhaps it will be as it is in the book, where she sees Conrad and “just knows.” This is a girl who Susannah reminds the audience in a flashback “knows her heart,” and who tells us herself she won’t change her mind. Perhaps we can assume that in her heart is Cousins Beach and the “other people” she tells Susannah she wishes to swim with.

So, finally on what we had, and what we lost, and also on forgiveness. We too had better find our own way to celebrate an ending arriving amidst the complication of what I kind of knew right at the beginning of the season: that our story of this incomparable, electric, and infinite love was not going to be perfect, but compromised. Not how we “pictured” or dreamed it might be. 

The portrayal of Belly made her moderately unlikeable, her inner motivations were hidden from us, Conrad was sanctified and made to look pathologically obsessed, and Jere made crying faces for most of the last episode to rival Dawson Leary. There is a minority of the dedicated (as opposed to casual) audience that wasn’t alienated by at least some of this in some way.

To those amongst them, I conclude that
none of it can be undone at this late stage or by whatever happens on screen next week. Here’s the contradiction now created, I also think all our Summers might be coming at once—and Christmas too—delivered in a Jenny Han–style gift box with a big red bow next episode, whether we still want what we put on our Christmas list or not. Who knows if it will or can feel right? I’m still not even convinced I don’t prefer Agnes, so welcome was her return and the version of Conrad I adore that she brings out in him.

So maybe we also will have our own grieving to do. For some it will be for the books and the story and themes they held true, for others a goodbye to the characters and places we loved. In either case, this is it folks: the moment we were all originally waiting for, the moment it becomes ‘real’ for Belly, ahem sorry Isabel, and Conrad. The only story arc besides that belonging to a bickering Laurel and John, and that emerging connection between Jere and his new bestie D, is Conrad and Belly. Whatever you want to say about it, it was one hell of a ride.

Shout out must of course go to Taylor Jewell, for being the only one who would answer Conrad’s texts. Who meant it when she said, “I’ll let you know how she is.”

Second place to Adam, for bringing the wedding champagne to Thanksgiving and cutting Jere off, but mainly for looking at Steven with a glint of approval and pride in his eyes when he quit his job at Breaker. No doubt, as Laurel affirms to Jeremiah, he is proud of these kids who are all—Jere in the kitchen, Conrad back excelling in Dr Namase’s program, Belly in Paris, and Taylor unafraid to be loved—fearless, in the way you learn to be at that age of your life, standing firmly on their own two feet. Our kids. All grown up.

Third place to Conrad for the way he says “Bye” to Laurel on the phone. Just do yourself a favour and go back and watch it.

* **3-4 tbs Gochugaru** (for heat and color, use 4 tbs for extra spicy)
* **2 tbs** **soy sauce powder** (as a substitute for hydrolyzed soy protein)
* **1 tbs** **dried mushroom seasoning** (provides umami depth)
* **1/2 tbs garlic powder**
* **1 /2 tbs onion powder**
* **1 tsp ground black pepper**
* **1 tsp ground ginger** (for warmth and depth)
* **1 tsp sea salt** (optional, to reduce sodium content)
* **1 tsp sugar** (optional, to balance out the spice and flavor, omit if you don’t need the sweetness)

Something you always have at home. It's so common that we don't really have discussions or communities dedicated to it.

What's really surprising to me is seeing how popular Shin Ramyun is here. For decades, it's been the undisputed number one ramen in Korea, but I always thought it wasn't as well-known overseas. I thought Buldak was pretty much the only Korean ramen foreigners knew about, but looking at this community, I can see I was wrong.

And I wanted to share some of the other instant ramens that Koreans love. There are so many kinds—Yukgaejang, Neoguri, Twigim-Udon, Jjapagetti, Chamkkae Ramen, Moopama and more. Now that I think about it, almost all of these are Nongshim products. I guess a lot of Koreans' go-to ramens are from Nongshim.

Anyway, thanks so much for the love for Korean ramen! Hope you all keep enjoying it!

Each flavor was different. The classic Spicy is that perfect balance of deep chili kick and savory broth, the Beef Broth has a rich warmth that feels extra hearty, and the Spicy Creamy Stir Fry is such a fun twist with its creamy heat.

All three members have the same flavor, which is the same as the regular Shin Ramyun. (No Zoey hamburger flavor for us, sadly!) Reflecting this, the lettering has also been changed to abide legal regulations for packaged/processed foods.

There are also 2 lid variants: one has the standard promo pose we've seen a million times, the other has the ""How It's Done"" ending pose. These are seemingly assigned at complete random, as both lid designs appear across all 3 members. Personally, I like the ""How It's Done"" version more.

Next up are the photo zones! There were a total of four in the KDH area: two in the HuntRix mission zone, one in the Saja Boys mission zone, and one inside the merch shop.

* **HuntRix Mission Zone (Photo Zone #1):** As soon as you enter, there’s a setup recreating the airplane “mukbang scene” from the beginning of KDH.
* **HuntRix Mission Zone (Photo Zone #2):** After finishing the missions, you’ll find a photo spot with the ring(?) that Lumi rode during the *Golden* stage performance in the later part of the story.
* **Saja Boys Mission Zone:** After completing the missions, there’s a spot where you can wear a *gat* (traditional Korean hat) and take pictures.
* **Merch Shop:** Inside the shop, they built a backdrop inspired by the train interior from the big post–train battle scene.

By the time I cleared all the missions, it was already lunchtime, so I went to the restaurant right in front of the zone. They were selling both a HuntRix Set and a Saja Boys Set. I went with the HuntRix Set, which was themed after the airplane mukbang scene foods — gimbap, tteokbokki, dakgangjeong (sweet crispy chicken), sundae (Korean sausage), and a special edition *Rumi Superstar-flavor Shin Ramyun*.

When you order either the HuntRix or Lion Boys Set, you also get a poster and a special Toowoomba sauce pack with Jinwoo’s illustration on it as a bonus. The whole restaurant interior was decorated with KDH characters, and even the outdoor tables were redesigned to look like giant cup noodles.

I took tons of photos, so in my next post I’ll cover the merch shop and all the KDH goods I bought!",,selftext,KpopDemonhunters,Acrobatic-Chain977,21,21,1.0,3,False,False,True,False,,,Events  :mira_silhouette::zoey_silhouette::rumi_silhouette:,self.KpopDemonhunters,1758973994.0,2025-09-27T11:53:14+00:00

Another batch is coming — here's how to get it. [Korea JoongAng Daily],"In Netflix hit “KPop Demon Hunters,” ramyeon isn’t just food — it’s practically a shared ritual among the members of HUNTR/X, the demon-hunting K-pop girl group. Sensing an opportunity to capitalize on the film’s buzz, Korea’s leading instant noodle maker, Nongshim, has jumped in with a limited-edition Shin Ramyun release inspired by the animated flick.  
   
The 1,000 sets of limited-edition Nongshim Shin Ramyun instant noodles featuring Zoey, Rumi, and Mira sold out instantly when sales opened on the company’s online store.  
   
But that doesn’t mean the Hunters are completely out of luck. The ramyeon maker will open another limited run, releasing 1,000 more sets at a later date. The more common Nongshim ramyeon flavors with “KPop Demon Hunters” packaging are widely available throughout stores in Korea, as well as in countries in North America, Europe, Oceania and Southeast Asia.

The Korea JoongAng Daily is here to clear up any confusion surrounding the “KPop Demon Hunters” inspired instant noodle.

**Q. Did the “KPop Demon Hunters” instant noodles sell out?**  
   
A. Some of them did. The “special” Shin Ramyun, referring to the Shin Ramyun cup noodles that replicated the design of the ones that HUNTR/X members Zoey, Rumi and Mira ate in the film, is sold out as of press time. Nongshim sold 1,000 sets, with each set consisting of six cup noodles — two sets of cup noodles themed after each of the three members — were off the shelves only one minute and 40 seconds after the sales began on Aug. 29.  
   
Nongshim told the Korea JoongAng Daily that it plans to sell 1,000 more sets in the near future, but the sales of the “special” edition ramyeons will remain exclusive to Nongshim's online store in Korea; there are no plans to sell them overseas.

Recently I have tried these:  
\- Carbonara Buldak ramen: Wasn't for me - too spicy and no flavor, however I liked the juicy noodles a lot!  
\- Shin Ramyun Premium Black: I liked this one a lot more - I should note I tried both with the ""ramen hack"" that's been going around on tiktok (the one with kewpie mayo, and garlic), but wish the noodles was as juicy as the ones in the Carbonara Buldak Ramen.

And then lastly, as for my 'favorite ramen', (since I figured I can't make this post without adding my own one), it's a pretty standard found ramen package here, very cheap too, but it's always a staple in my cupboard!

Spoiler: they weren't. I had no particular feelings towards Jin Ramen, but I loved Ottogi's Cheese Ramen, so when I saw the rebranded version of it, I decided to give it a try and compare the experience. 

[the package in question](https://preview.redd.it/labraigs7dpf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a590aa306c40dec338033490e012f9ee480307)

Well, I'll give it one thing - it certainly does *look* better than before. Sadly, that's it. The old Ottogi Cheese was salty, cheesy and a little spicy - just enough to keep things interesting. The new OTOKI Cheesy is just bland, not spicy at all and almost not even salty enough (and this is coming from someone who thinks Shin Ramyun is borderline too salty). A big hearty bowl of disappointment that was, but at least it looked pretty enough to take a picture.

Salty: ⭐⭐⭐✰✰

Sour/Tangy: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✰

Sweet: ⭐⭐✰✰✰

Umami: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✰

Heat: ⭐⭐✰✰✰✰✰✰✰✰

Quick Flavor Notes: Tangy, rich, bright, umami, funky

Texture: Medium thick and somewhat chunky

Recommended: Yes

Ingredients: Distilled Vinegar, Habanero, Garlic, Carrot, Ginger, Guajillo, Miso, Salt

I’ve been a fan of Ferm Foundations sauces since the moment I tasted my first sauce from them, their Serrano Mustard Hot Sauce. Since then I’ve loved their Lemon Serrano and Guajillo Habanero hot sauces as well as their Manchester Kimchi which they sadly no longer sell online. The Manchester, PA based hot sauce maker does exactly what their name implies and ferments all of their sauces for that special extra depth of flavor and lactic funk you can only get through that process. Pun Croc is one of their newest sauces and features a label design that’s a departure from their previous circus-tent look.

I would be remiss if I didn’t speak more about the label. I love a good pun, and this one is a visual one as well as one that lampshades itself. Pun Crock, Punk Rock, and the Croc is dressed as a Punk Rocker, get it? It made me giggle at least. Ingredients-wise this sauce is actually very similar to their Guajillo Habanero sauce. It omits the red bell pepper, adds ginger and miso, and ups the garlic quantity. It’s actually an interesting blend because you have something that’s almost a Caribbean style sauce with the habaneros, carrots, and garlic, then there’s the guajillos which are typically found in Mexican style sauces, and finally an Asian twist with the ginger and the miso. The texture of Pun Croc is pleasantly chunky and on the thicker side. The aroma is very fresh, there’s some habanero and vinegar to the nose but overall it smells very clean.

When it comes to flavor Ferm Foundations Pun Croc is tangy at the forefront but also very rich tasting. There’s a good blend of vinegar and lactic brine to the tang so that it doesn’t read as super vinegary. The guajillos bring a lot of their flavor to the party – a little smoky, rich, raisin-y, and fruity in a dark way. Brighter heat and some fruity notes from the habaneros compliment the darker guajillo flavor. The ginger is fairly forward as well with it’s characteristic spicy peppery bite. What’s really interesting is how the miso and carrots interact. There’s a gentle sweetness that comes in after the initial wave of peppers and ginger that’s mixed with an umami funk. It’s a complex sauce in that it starts off a bit Mexican or Caribbean and finishes Asian, and also because it hits a lot of different flavor ‘notes’ with what I’d consider bass in the guajillos and miso with that dark rich flavor, midrange with the habaneros, and treble with the zingy ginger.

I found this sauce to work very well with a pretty wide variety of foods. The ginger and miso elements make it serve well with Asian dishes, and I enjoyed this to add some extra zing to some Korean cold noodles as well as to kick up some Shin Ramyun. At the same time this works just as well with western cuisine and it’s a great sandwich sauce as well as surprisingly great in breakfast burritos. I got a good deal on some pork belly slices at Costco and decided to marinate some in miso and some in doenjang before grilling, which I found out too late leads to the marinades burning and charring. Nevertheless I found this sauce to go great with the parts I was able to scrape the char off from.

I’m happy to recommend Ferm Foundations Pun Croc. I loved their Guajillo Habanero and I feel this sauce takes that theme and improves on it. If you’re looking for a sauce that’s a great example of east meets west, this is one is a must try. Pun Crock is also all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.",,selftext,hotsauce,MagnusAlbusPater,9,9,0.81,3,False,False,False,False,,,Purchase,reddit.com,1756743705.0,2025-09-01T16:21:45+00:00

Analysts attribute the surge to growing expectations surrounding collaborations such as the Netflix animation \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim, once the leader in South Korea’s domestic ramen market, lost its position as the top ramen stock to Samyang Foods in May last year. While Nongshim’s stock price saw little movement, Samyang Foods’ shares soared, driven by its Buldak Ramen. At the shareholders’ meeting in March, complaints erupted: “A company’s competitiveness lies in its market capitalization, and Nongshim is lacking.”

Nongshim’s sluggish stock price began to rebound, riding on the popularity of \*KPop Demon Hunters\*. Reactions continued that the cup ramen and snacks featured in the series reminded viewers of Shin Ramyun and Shrimp Crackers. Nongshim confirmed the collaboration with Netflix, releasing limited-edition products featuring characters from \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim plans to sustain this momentum. The company has set specific targets: achieving sales of 7.3 trillion Korean won and an operating profit margin of 10% by 2030. It also aims to expand overseas sales to 61% of total revenue.

Nongshim has partnered with Netflix to release a product featuring characters from 'KPop Demon Hunters'. /Courtesy of Nongshim

anyway it still was good but i would have liked it to be a tad bit drier. ",,selftext,InstantRamen,Cedosg,6,6,0.8,11,False,False,False,False,,,Korean Instant Noodles,reddit.com,1756679106.0,2025-08-31T22:25:06+00:00

You know back in the days I was like yeah, I have one more chance, maybe next time I will do better. But knowing this is my last year, my last chance, whenever we lose, it hits me harder.","[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txvrrvW1cqk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txvrrvW1cqk)

**dGon and Jeesun: With the win you are now 1 win away from your 8th LCK title how do you feel?**

**Peanut**: I don’t know maybe because it was a quick and clean 3-0, because yesterday when I was thinking to myself. I was wondering about the emotion I was going to go through after having my last Lol Park match but it was a very quick 3-0 for me so it feels so good. And all I am thinking is that I really want to win it all, I want to go all the way to the finals and win the trophy and have a really great ending here.

**dGon and Jeesun: I tweeted out your gifts that you brought to Lol Park which were amazing, that you brought for the staff. Thanking them for so many years of their effort. But a lot of the audience don’t know why you brought those gifts, would you like to share why you brought the gifts to Lol Park?**

**Peanut:**  Not long ago that I realize that I was able to reach here because of all of the hard work from the staff at Lol Park and I never gotten the chance to actually appreciate their work so I wanted to give them a little gift to show that I am really grateful for their hard work so that was a little gift from me.

**dGon and Jeesun: You played across so many different teams throughout your career but you have also been able to forge so many relationships with different players. What did forming those relationships through competition mean to you?**

**Peanut:** When I just started, I was a troublemaker but all the hyungs around me helped me be more mature. So with that experience, I think I have grown so much. So with these great people around me I am very confident that I will be able to build another great life after my professional career.

**dGon and Jeesun: You know as a player you have achieved so much success for such a long span of time. And League of Legends is now bringing in newer players into the pro field. What advice would you give to the younger generation of players striving to have a career like yours?**

**Peanut:** 1st and foremost you really got to be lucky in order to go through the path that I walked.  You really have to have good luck. Secondly, what I can say for sure is I really have good discipline so whenever I wanted to do what others are doing or spend my time somewhere else. I didn’t, I locked in, I always focused on what matters the most as a professional player so you must keep that in mind.

**dGon and Jeesun: With so many moments that other pros can only dream of. Bringing up a few would be difficult but when you think about some of the greatest moments of your career. What comes to mind?**

**Peanut:** Of course, there are so many, but right now the match that I played today. The last match at Lol Park means the most to me, but I know that LCK Finals is right ahead of me which is very important and then Worlds is around the corner as well. I came into this year thinking this is going to be my last year, knowing that it is going to be my last so every moment kind of meant a lot to me and I am going to keep on going forward. 

**dGon and Jeesun: Well you definitely mean a lot to all the fans from around the world. Speaking of LCK and Worlds. This is your last run here for both, LCK is one game away, Worlds is in the future. How are you experiencing this specific run differently than the many times you have done it in the past.**

**Peanut:** Well I always you know, keep the same mindset you know, but this year for sure. I was like yeah, this is my last year, let’s just grind and accomplish whatever I want to. And then the biggest difference was that, especially when I was losing. You know back in the days I was like yeah, I have one more chance, maybe next time I will do better. But knowing this is my last year, my last chance, whenever we lose, it hits me harder. Like back in the days I was able to shake things off really quickly and pick myself up together. I have become a lot more emotional because I knew that this was my last year, so that was the biggest difference.

**dGon and Jeesun: Chat’s really emotional right now haha.Finally on the wall we have photos of your career. The many different teams you have been on, what kind of memories come out when you see not only Hanwha Peanut but also Gen.G Peanut, Nongshim Peanut, LGD Peanut, ROX Tigers Peanut, what memories come out?**

**Peanut:** Yeah I have been in a lot of different teams and I am very proud, not only in the LCK but also in other regions. I was able to reach somewhere very high and looking back at those old photos. Well, I do look very young so haha.

Something you always have at home. It's so common that we don't really have discussions or communities dedicated to it.

What's really surprising to me is seeing how popular Shin Ramyun is here. For decades, it's been the undisputed number one ramen in Korea, but I always thought it wasn't as well-known overseas. I thought Buldak was pretty much the only Korean ramen foreigners knew about, but looking at this community, I can see I was wrong.

And I wanted to share some of the other instant ramens that Koreans love. There are so many kinds—Yukgaejang, Neoguri, Twigim-Udon, Jjapagetti, Chamkkae Ramen, Moopama and more. Now that I think about it, almost all of these are Nongshim products. I guess a lot of Koreans' go-to ramens are from Nongshim.

Anyway, thanks so much for the love for Korean ramen! Hope you all keep enjoying it!

Also decided to make them in the most frowned upon way possible. 

The Prep: 

2 packs of Noodles and flakes go in this tupperware

Hot tap water eyeballed to be slightly above the noodles

Microwave 4 minutes (1000 watt microwave) 

Flip noodles and microwave 30 more seconds

Drain ""most"" of the water, eyeballed what looked like enough to make the sauce (and not turn it into broth)

Mixed in the powder base and oil packets, the sauce came out viscous and coated the noodles effectively. 

Taste test - slightly bland, added a light sprinkle of seasoned salt, helped balance flavor profile out effectively

Eat!

-

The *Experience*:

Right off the bat I can tell why this is such s divisive and controversial flavor. It is earthy with a hint of bitterness. These characteristics however, pair very nicely with the umami main show. They are more like hints than statements. Ate the whole bowl, and I'm happy I bought the 4 pack so I can have some more. Not my favorite Nongshim (that title currently goes to Toomba or Shin Black) but solidly enjoyable. 8/10",,title|selftext,InstantRamen,Shiznoz222,136,136,0.94,56,False,False,False,False,,,Instant Ramen Review,i.redd.it,1758253601.0,2025-09-19T03:46:41+00:00

That aside, let's get started. 

In the LPL, League's Greatest Disappointment LGD, and the amazing one fan team UP, got eliminated early last week on the 1st and 2nd.

In the LCK, the Bros decided to give other teams a chance and bowed out of worlds contention. Joining them are the noodle boys at Nongshim. 

In the LEC, BDS and TH got knocked out of playoffs and worlds contention. 

In the LCP, the last light of Japan, DFM, sputtered out for the year, closing a ten year worlds streak for the nation. 

Finally in the LTA, LOUD and C9 are both done for the year. 



Eliminated teams by region and date noted as eliminated: 

* OMG- LPL, 8/18 
* RNG- LPL, 8/18 
* LNG- LPL, 8/24
* TT- LPL, 8/24
* WE- LPL, 8/31
* FPX- LPL, 8/31
* LGD- LPL, 9/9
* UP- LPL, 9/9
* DNF- LCK, 8/18
* DRX- LCK, 8/31
* BRO- LCK. 9/9
* NS- LCK. 9/9
* Navi- LEC, 8/18
* SK- LEC, 8/31
* BDS- LEC, 9/9
* TH- LEC, 9/9
* Chiefs- LCP, 8/24
* SHG- LCP, 8/24
* DFM- LCP, 9/9
* FXW7- LTAS, 8/24
* ISG- LTAS, 8/24
* Furia- LTAS, 8/31
* Lev- LTAS, 8/31
* LOUD- LTAS, 9/9 
* DIG- LTAN, 8/24
* Lyon- LTAN, 8/24
* DSG- LTAN, 8/31
* TL- LTAN, 8/31
* C9- LTAN, 9/9 

In the LPL, 8 teams are competing to be among the 4 teams that go to worlds from the region. 

In the LCK, 4 teams will go to worlds, but one of the slots already belongs to GENG. 

In the LEC, 3 teams go to worlds, two of which are MKOI and G2. That leaves one slot for any of GX, KC, FNC, and VIT. 

In the LCP, 3 teams go to worlds. Two of them will be CFO and PSG. The last slot will be a Vietnamese team, with only GAM, MKVE, and TSW alive for the other spot.

Finally, in the LTA there are 3 seeds to go around. Two of them will be FLY and VKS. The last one will be one of PAIN, RED, SR, or 100T.

When you walk the street, it's mostly food trucks and the art market. Very few activations.

The Peroni activation is a ""paid buy"" for snacks and drinks this year. That explains why there's no line, and it's practically empty in there. However, they are handing out small cup samples of the 0.0% (non-alcoholic beer).

The Ferrero Rocher line is very long, but I'm told they're just giving out little sample squares this year. No bars to take away like in the past. At least that's what I heard from strangers exiting.

Probably the only two worth lining up for are Intrepid and Nongshim. Intrepid has a photo-op and free tote bag. Nongshim has a noodle + puff sample, plus you spin a wheel for a gift.

If you went to other activations that you thought were good, let me know. Criterion Closet?

I'm hoping to check out the Visa Infinite Studio Lounge. It's new this year but only open Days 2-7 of the festival in the evenings.

(i.e Referring to the Legend Group as ‘Upper Moons’, etc) I’m not versed in anime at all, so some of the references may sound awkward.\*\***

 

**<Intro>**

We’re into our 2^(nd) day of Play-Ins, so I thought I’d do a midway checkup for the two series we’ve had. Before actually going into each individual series more in-depth, I’ll start by covering the things that I’ve noticed in a more broader sense over the past two days.

 

The first thing that I noticed were the differences in the level of play between our Upper and Lower Moons. More specifically, the relatively small levels of difference in levels of gameplay between our non-Upper-Upper Moon teams.

Okay, okay. I’m sorry I’ve been making all these Demonslayer references lately. Hm. So by Upper-Upper moons, I mean our Big Three. Now, trying to figure out whether or not KT fits into that mix is a whole different issue. But in general, I got this feeling that everyone else outside that group are really not that much different in skill from one another.

No, it’s not anything new. Similar things have been said all throughout the regular season, and a lot of people also expected these dynamics to be reflected in our postseason as well. That’s why so many casters and analysts have predicted these Play-In series to go to full Game 5s, with the games being incredibly back-and-forth. So I guess that ended up playing out as expected.

 

The second thing is that the importance of drafts became much higher with the introduction of Hard Fearless, with games also becoming a lot more polarizing because of it. This is a pretty big point in and of itself, so I want to split this up into two parts.

The first part has to do with how teams are now more concerned with the element of ‘balance’ in their drafts and compositions. You know, when it comes to allocating and ironing out the Tank-Damage balance within their team comps.

So it’s a no-brainer that having a good balance of damage dealers and frontlines in your composition is a good thing. Same goes for how the more CC your comp has, the better. This is pretty obvious. But the thing is that teams now have to deal with the concept of ‘scarcity’ when drafting for these kinds of aspects, with Fearless making it harder for these ‘balances’ to be met the longer a series goes on.

Say you’re in draft, and searching for a tank champion for your team’s frontline. You not only have a limited number of positions where tanks can be drafted, but the pool of viable tanks to choose from also becomes increasingly limited. So you really need to figure out how to address this from a draft perspective. Either by finding the exact champion for the exact role in the exact position that best suits your needs, or by figuring out an alternative way to play without it.

The second part has to do with AD junglers. It’s a well-known fact that AD bruiser junglers are very good in the current meta. But the ‘good’ ones are also quite limited in quantity, where they either get used up or banned out incredibly fast throughout the course of a series. So as a team, it’s crucial that you have some good contingency plans to pull out once those limitations are put in place.

Personally, I think having an AD Midlaner + AP Jungler combination as a backup plan will turn out quite effective in the current Bo5 environment, and feel a lot of teams are internally trying to figure out their own variation of this approach. This is because the concept of scarcity that applies to AD Junglers also applies to AP Midlaners by association, right? So having your own, neat gameplan of pulling out some AD Midlaners and AP Junglers opens up so many more variations when it comes to draft.

 

These two things stood out most to me during our 2 days of Play-Ins, and I think they’ll be quite relevant in all of our upcoming postseason games that don’t involve our Upper-Upper Moons, or the Big Three.

This also kind of ties into the reason so many people flocked to my stream today. “Cloudtemplar, do you feel betrayed by DK today after all the trust you gave them in recent weeks?”, “Cloudtemplar, are you disappointed in DK or NS after their Play-In showings?”

To be honest, kind of. Not in a way where I’m like mad or angry at them or anything, but just a bit disappointed. But not in a very big way either. I mentioned earlier that all of our non-Upper-Upper Moon teams were all not too far apart, right? I’ve thought that way for a while, and I’ve also drilled that point in pretty hard both on cast and on my stream for weeks on end. So I’m not TOO surprised by how our recent Play-In games turned out.

Now, I didn’t expect DK to lose. That wasn’t something that I saw coming at all. In the back of my mind, the “Nah, they’re still the highest ranked Lower Moon” kind of thoughts always trumped the potential scenarios and ‘what-ifs’ of teams like BFX upsetting DK. DK are a team that once were an Upper Moon themselves, right? So I genuinely didn’t see this loss coming at all. Damn. Maybe DK’s problems were indeed a lot worse than I had predicted. Not to a \*gasp\* “DK are so unbelievably bad!” kind of level, but I did have moments during cast today where “Wait, were DK actually THIS bad?”

 

**<NS vs. BRO>**

Let’s cover Day 1 first. This game was interesting, because despite NS coming in with no wins to show for R3-5, an Upper Moon is still an Upper Moon, right?

“Can you please stop with the damn Upper and Lower Moon crap you dweeb?”

Okay, okay. I’ll tone it down a notch. The point I was trying to make was that despite NS’s Legend Group record, the notion that they were heavily favored because they were still a Legend team was definitely there. It seemed like that was the case for a bit, right? But the game ended up going to Game 5 and ending in a 3:2.

But the 3:2 scoreline was definitely one where I feel NS came out definitely ahead, or one where they showed that they were still clearly better. We’ve had a couple series like this in the past, right? Like we’ve even had 3:0s where you still come out thinking that the difference between the winner and loser wasn’t that big. I know this may sound weird, but the aspect of identical, or similar scorelines telling entirely different stories is 100% there. If you know, you know.

 

I say this because I feel NS walked out of that 3:2 as the clearly better team. Let me elaborate. There’s not really too much need to cover Games 1 and 2, because those games were won by NS by them just playing really well. What happened after is what needs to be addressed. Especially once they pulled out their 4/5 Pool build again for Game 3.

 

**Game 3 Draft**

\- BRO (Blue)

Bans : Gwen – Poppy – Vi / Lulu – Bard

Picks : Taliyah / Renekton – Sivir / Rell – Olaf

 

\- NS (Red)

Bans : Yone – Yunara – Azir / Sejuani – Rakan

Picks : XinZhao – Sion / Ahri / Caitlyn / Elise

 

Now, I think the decision to pull out their cheese was a sound one. Especially when it comes to it’s timing at this specific point in the series where they were leading 2:0. Decisively win 2:0, then finish the series 3:0 with a NS cheese-special. Bam.

 

“Reee what’s a 4/5 Pool? Stop using Starcraft terminology you boomer, reeeee”

 

For the uncultured, a 4/5 Pool is an extreme, early-game cheese strategy in Brood War. It’s when you funnel all your early-game resources into an all-out offensive. If it succeeds, you win. If you don’t, you basically lose. This is because you’ve forgone all your earlygame investment in resource generation, which basically renders your game unplayable. So when I say ‘4/5 Pool’ or ‘4-Drone Rush’, that indicates an unorthodox, cheese-resembling strategy where you all-in on the early game.

 

So in my opinion, the decision to bring out the Elise to close out Game 3 early for a 3:0 sweep was a pretty good one. Great timing. And to be honest, they actually drafted a really good comp to do so for Game 3 as well. It was to a level where it’s one of those cheese strats that you can’t do anything about, even with prior knowledge of it coming.

Think about it. Using the Elise’s extreme earlygame strength combined with the Caitlyn to hard push the enemy, and tying that in by pressuring all areas of the map with other champions like the XinZhao. Like you KNOW that’s coming, right? But even if you have full knowledge about what’s going to happen, actually fending it off successfully in-game is an entirely different thing. A much more difficult thing at that.

Oh yeah. That, and also because they had won their two previous games in such a convincing manner using ‘standard’ styles of play. So if NS were going to bring out their cheese, Game 3 was the perfect time to do so. So them bringing out something like the Elise in Game 3 isn’t something I have, or had a problem with. Not at all.

 

But it came down to in-game variables, right? To be blunt, it was as if Gideon got possessed for a minute in Game 3. Like he got randomly charmed by something we weren’t able to see. He felt a sudden need to go in for some reason, and the game just went boom from there.

It’s one of those decisions that doesn’t make sense even during post-game analysis. He could have just backed off even after losing the smite fight on Red. He could have just backed off, and it would have made all the sense in the world. Why? Because his Botlane was hard pushing BRO’s regardless of how that Red Buff interaction went. But the fact that he decided to re-engage, with the ensuing fight ending in 3 deaths for NS was an absolute disaster. The game just ended right then and there, all because of a decision that made absolutely no sense at all.

So it’s really hard to say something about BRO for Game 3. Sure, BRO did come up with a decent draft, and it’s also true that Croco handled that situation to his team’s favor. But it’s really hard to come up with a definitive conclusion on BRO for Game 3 because that early game boom was almost purely Gideon’s doing. It’s also not the Elise, or the fault of NS’s cheese that led to their Game 3 loss. Game 3 was genuinely a very reasonable and quite frankly, a great time to pull out things like the Elise. So I really don’t think it’s fair, or right to fault NS’s decisions or drafts for what happened in Game 3.

Lane like the Caitlyn-Elise, and especially the Caitlyn-Elise – are so, so much harder to deal with in-game than what meets the eye. It’s not just another ‘’lane-dominant’ combo. It’s so powerful to where you can’t deal with it in lane, even IF you 100% know exactly what the Caitlyn and Elise are going to do in-game. So I do think that drawing a ‘what-if’ for a timeline where Gideon didn’t make that mistake during Game 3 is pretty valid.

 

Okay. So NS cruised through their first 2 games, then got into a massive accident during Game 3. Spilt milk. So as NS, you now have to move on and focus on Game 4. Let’s take a look at the draft.

 

**Game 4 Draft**

NS (Blue)

Bans : Yorick – Poppy – Akali / Leona – K’Sante

Picks : Yone / Nocturne – Jayce / Viktor – Blitzcrank

 

BRO (Red)

Bans : Yunara – Azir – Sylas / Mell – Bard

Picks : Maokai – Ziggs / Tristana / Jax / Rakan

 

Game 4 is where I can definitely give BRO some props. When it came to Game 4, BRO did a really good job during Draft. This. This, was a very, very good draft. Why? First of all, BRO were put in a situation where NS stole away their Yone on Blue 1. So BRO counter this by denying the Maokai, and also picking the Ziggs. They then proceed to supplement their composition with an AD Midlaner in Tristana. After seeing this, NS desperately try and bolster their sidelane strengths, which resulted in them digging themselves into a deeper hole for Phase 2.

Now, a lot of this game DID have to do with in-game play as well. I don’t want the focus to only go to Gideon, but a big part of this loss had to do with Nocturne being really lacking. Well, specifically in terms of how NS weren’t able to really make good use of the Nocturne at all. This, I think played the biggest part in NS’s Game 4 loss.

To start, Croco was there to countergank Nocturne as Maokai at all the right times. That, in and of itself makes absolutely no sense – considering it was the Maokai that was counterganking all of Nocturne’s timings. In addition, Gideon’s gank timings were all either extremely telegraphed or had little to no grounds for execution as well.

I don’t like backseat driving proplayers, but I do think I have some right to do so when it comes to the older, more classic Jungle champions like Nocturne. Especially when it comes to Nocturne, because I can confidently say that I was the one that invented the core macro strategies that had to do with Nocturne back in my day.

So one thing in common about NS in Game 4, along with players and teams that don’t play the Nocturne very well in general, is that they aren’t able to utilize the Paranoia effectively. When it comes down to it, being able to figure out and gauge the situation the moment you turn off the lights is the most important thing when it comes to Nocturne and the Paranoia. Like you’re supposed to turn off the lights, and play accordingly after properly evaluating the situation once the global blind is imposed. But what a lot of players and teams that aren’t very good with the Nocturne do, is just slamming the trigger the moment the Paranoia is used. In essence, it’s all about timing, and the players being able to play appropriately.

On that note, I got a strong feeling that Gideon and NS were not very sharp, or keen on this aspect at all during Game 4. So that, compounded with Croco coming through with some very good countergank timings was what resulted in a pretty big Jungle diff for Game 4. So that fed into NS’s comp not really working out at all, given that it had so many picks with some very strong and ‘defined’ identities. Calix’s Yone was also rather disappointing, where the Yone wasn’t really able to come up with anything good in the fights that happened.

So Game 4 was one of those games where two BRO-favored factors were both in play at the same time. Not only did BRO have their extremely good draft going for them, but NS’s rather poor level of play was also working to BRO’s favor as well. NS were playing uh, very weird. Weird, to where their desperate plays ended up in the game just kind of crumbling for them. To where I felt that BRO were able to pull off the Game 4 BECAUSE they were well-versed in the Yone themselves. BRO played very well.

In hindsight – yes. A tank Jungler like Sejuani would have been much better for NS. But it’s not like NS’s rationale behind the Nocturne was nonexistent by any means, right? Like that Nocturne was picked specifically to strengthen their control over the sidelanes. The problem ended up being in what played out in-game, where Croco was able to read all of Gideon and Nocturne’s angles like a book. Every time Gideon tried to do something on the Nocturne, Croco’s Maokai was always following up at exactly the right time. That’s where Game 4 went wry.

Like there 100% was a world where this NS Draft for Game 4 could have worked out exactly how NS wanted. Okay. The point I’m trying to make is that this Game 4 was one where BRO’s exceptionally good draft and good in-game play resulted in their win over NS. They got hard stomped in Games 1 and 2, and Game 3 was one where NS just hard threw the game early. Game 4 was the one where BRO played extremely well all the way from draft, which resulted in them winning primarily due to their own well-doing.

 

So now, NS is in quite a predicament. Up until the end of Game 2, it seemed like they were in a very good position to 3:0 sweep the series. Then they ended up hard throwing Game 3, and then got heavily outdrafted and outplayed in Game 4.

Now moving on to Game 5. The Game 5 draft was also very interesting.

 

**Game 5 Draft**

NS (Blue)

Bans : Poppy – Yorick – Smolder / Zed – TahmKench

Picks : Vi / Gnar – Galio / Zeri – Taric

 

BRO (Red)

Bans : Yunara – Azir – Shen / Kalista – Varus

Picks : K’Sante – Jhin / Cassiopeia / Leona – Sylas

 

The Game 5 draft was interesting, because it was one where I want to give props to both sides. Both sides came up with their own answers to the draft ‘balance’ predicament I mentioned earlier. The respective compositions of both sides each had their own little ‘kick’ to it, and I found both of them quite interesting.

So it all boiled down to what happened in-game. Now, I ended up voting Kingen as POM on Wednesday, but if you were to ask me the exact lane that ended up deciding the result of the series – it would have to be the Jungle. In terms of the ceilings and floors of each team’s Junglers that were realized over the course of this series, the Jungle was what ended up determining who came out ahead.

As you saw throughout this series, Gideon’s lows were really low. But on the other hand, the highs that come about are also really high. Croco is also like Gideon in this exact manner in many ways. Croco’s highs are also high, but there’s also times where he’s sometimes overly rushed in what he tries to do. I can’t really think of a lighter way to explain it, but it was kind of a ‘throw-off’ of sorts. As in which Jungler throws more, or less than the other being the determining factor of the series. Like there definitely was an aspect of the winner being decided based off of their Jungler throwing less than the other.

It's not like the dive angles were absolutely unreasonable for BRO though. Like they’re definitely angles that I feel the players on BRO COULD have seen. But ultimately, it ended up resulting in the Sylas falling behind – all in a composition where Sylas’s performance was crucial. The Sylas fell behind because of the failed dive early on, and this resulted in BRO essentially coming across a massive wall in terms of playing out their Game 5.

 

“Was BRO’s comp one that was on a timer?”

 

No. Their composition was one where they’re just fine with the game being drawn out. But there was indeed an aspect of where they probably did want to pull something off, or get accelerated early. BRO’s Botlane was winning early, and both Junglers have pathed diagonally apart from one another. With BRO’s Sylas being on the Botside of the map, BRO decided to start a Botlane dive to score some points early. While I do think the reasoning was justified, I do think that it would have been better for BRO to have just played it safe and slow.

So yes, they were a bit ‘rushed’ in executing that Botlane dive to try and score some early points. But the rationale WAS there, because a successful dive would have resulted in their Botlane and the Sylas getting ahead. Considering that an accelerated or fed Sylas would have been extremely trick for NS to deal with, I think the decisionmaking process for BRO leading up to that dive was definitely there. Just look at NS’s Game 5 composition. That’s no ordinary buffet. That’s a premium, 5-star, world-class buffet for Sylas, right? High-value, tasty ults everywhere. The moment the Sylas got going in this Game 5, I don’t think NS would have been able to stop him. But alas. The Sylas never got a chance, because the entry fee ended up being too expensive for him.

The dive itself was totally a viable angle for BRO. The thing about tower dives is that there’s always so much variance for both the diver and divee, because of all the various situations that occur from how specific abilities are allocated. I guess Gideon’s Vi rushing towards Bot the moment the dive was about to take place also helped for NS. So at the end of the day, the dive setup just ended up not working out.

 

“Even if Nongshim were better, wasn’t their level of play a bit too low for an Upper Moon?”

 

That’s why I specifically brought up the term ‘Upper-Upper’ Moons, right? The difference in the level of play between everyone outside of that circle isn’t sizable at all. NS aren’t an Upper-Upper Moon. The real question is KT, and how strong the 4th Upper Moon is compared to everyone else. Everyone knows all the Upper Moons up until Akaza are incredibly strong. The level of Hantengu and exactly how strong he is, is the real question.

Though if we’re going by Demonslayer lore, KT being Hantengu means they’re gonna pack quite a punch. Like the only reason Tanjiro beats Hantengu is because of his main character buff and plot armor. Under no normal circumstance does Tanjiro beat Hantengu. Like come on. Tanjiro’s busted. He’s basically running around like Warwick and tracking everything with his sense of smell, which hard counter’s Hantengu’s kit.

 

Okay, so that’s about good to wrap up the series. NS are now up against BFX. Hm. I think NS will beat BFX. NS are good. Despite the 3:2 scoreline, I honestly think NS looked pretty good.

As for BRO, I’m gonna repeat the same reference I made earlier this week. BRO is basically Zenitsu. The one Breathing Style that BRO does have, the Yone-Maokai – is really good if they’re able to use it. But just like Zenitsu, the Breathing Style is just a one-time thing, right? So I really think BRO having another Midlane AD + Jungle AP combo would help them going forward. The reason I keep emphasizing this is because the level of play BRO is able to come up with varies so much by the champions and compositions they play. To where everything else outside of the Yone-Maokai is considerably weaker, and I personally think it’s crucial that they address this issue before their next Play-In game.

The reason I suggest that they come up with another Mid AD + Jungle AP combo is that none of BRO’s future opponents for the rest of the year are EVER going to give them the Yone-Maokai. Everybody knows that the Yone-Maokai is BRO’s specialty, and no team is ever going to let both of them through during Draft. We’re no longer in the regular season, and there’s literally no sensible train of thought that would justify something like “Oh let’s give BRO their Yone-Maokai and counter it with something else.”

Wait. But their next opponent is DK. Hm. Maybe. Hmmmm. Nah. They wouldn’t. We’ll just have to wait and see.

 

Any additional questions about the NS vs. BRO series?

 

“We don’t care. Can you start beating up on DK already?""

“Are you still a DK believer after today?”

“Why is DK so bad?”

 

Uhh, ok. I guess we’re moving on to BFX vs. DK then.",,selftext,leagueoflegends,artisanal_cocaine,37,37,0.89,5,False,False,False,False,,,Esports,youtu.be,1757014483.0,2025-09-04T19:34:43+00:00

In the third game, Lee Jihyun also played well against Tan Xiao, establishing a lead in the middle game. However, Tan Xiao showed his shinogi skills and made a good shape inside black’s influence. Lee tried to go for the kill but it was an overplay and eventually he couldn’t hold it and lost the game. Tan Xiao displayed amazing shinogi skills again in the fourth game against Hsu Chiayuan and got two consecutive wins.

Another batch is coming — here's how to get it. [Korea JoongAng Daily],"In Netflix hit “KPop Demon Hunters,” ramyeon isn’t just food — it’s practically a shared ritual among the members of HUNTR/X, the demon-hunting K-pop girl group. Sensing an opportunity to capitalize on the film’s buzz, Korea’s leading instant noodle maker, Nongshim, has jumped in with a limited-edition Shin Ramyun release inspired by the animated flick.  
   
The 1,000 sets of limited-edition Nongshim Shin Ramyun instant noodles featuring Zoey, Rumi, and Mira sold out instantly when sales opened on the company’s online store.  
   
But that doesn’t mean the Hunters are completely out of luck. The ramyeon maker will open another limited run, releasing 1,000 more sets at a later date. The more common Nongshim ramyeon flavors with “KPop Demon Hunters” packaging are widely available throughout stores in Korea, as well as in countries in North America, Europe, Oceania and Southeast Asia.

The Korea JoongAng Daily is here to clear up any confusion surrounding the “KPop Demon Hunters” inspired instant noodle.

**Q. Did the “KPop Demon Hunters” instant noodles sell out?**  
   
A. Some of them did. The “special” Shin Ramyun, referring to the Shin Ramyun cup noodles that replicated the design of the ones that HUNTR/X members Zoey, Rumi and Mira ate in the film, is sold out as of press time. Nongshim sold 1,000 sets, with each set consisting of six cup noodles — two sets of cup noodles themed after each of the three members — were off the shelves only one minute and 40 seconds after the sales began on Aug. 29.  
   
Nongshim told the Korea JoongAng Daily that it plans to sell 1,000 more sets in the near future, but the sales of the “special” edition ramyeons will remain exclusive to Nongshim's online store in Korea; there are no plans to sell them overseas.

Technically. In a manner of speaking.,"Nongshim, the Korean food brand that has already collaborated with KPDH to release variois branded items, has now taken the honor of releasing the [very first KPDH game](https://www.nongshim.com/promotion/event/view/2025/09_saewookkang/mobile/saewookkang_event) on their mobile website!

Well, *technically.*

The gameplay is as simple as it comes, shrimp chips come flying onto the screen and you catch them by tapping to increase the gauge in the top left. The goal is to fill the gauge as fast as you can, and when you do the game will show you how long you took before taking you to a form where you can enter a sweepstakes/lucky draw for a prize box including all the KPDH Nongshim products out so far.

However the background is that of Zoey eating her chips and the title screen is branded with the KPDH logo, meaning this is **the very first game made out of the K-Pop Demon Hunters IP!**

It's not a terrible way to spend less than 30 seconds (a minute if you include filling out the sweepstakes form), so check it out I guess.

BGF Retail, which operates CU, said Monday that after the global success of “KPop Demon Hunters,” foreign customers are increasingly reaching for K-food items featured in the film, including gimbap, ramyeon, chips and gukbap (Korean soup with rice).

Over the July-August period, gimbap purchases by foreign customers surged 231 percent, while ready-to-eat meals and ramyeon rose 143 percent and 99 percent, respectively.

The movie, which highlights the adventures of a K-pop girl group, features characters enjoying various Korean foods, sparking social media challenges of eating gimbap in one bite. In response, CU recently launched its no-cut beef bulgogi gimbap, designed to be eaten whole, replicating the scenes from the film.

CU is also collaborating with top ramyeon manufacturer Nongshim, releasing limited packaging with movie characters on their snacks, as well as life-sized figures and dedicated stands at tourist spots.

“Convenience store gimbap has become a unique cultural experience for foreign visitors,” said Jeong Jae-hyun, team manager of BGF Retail convenience food. “We will continue to leverage global trends to deliver special products and experiences to our customers.”",,selftext,KpopDemonhunters,wosoandstuff2020,18,18,1.0,5,False,False,False,False,,,📰News📰,asianews.network,1758031003.0,2025-09-16T13:56:43+00:00

This is one of those culture details that gets muddied in mainstream media, but it matters. Ramen and ramyeon may have originated in around the same time but preparation and taste are worlds apart—ramyeon is spicier, bolder, heartier, and honestly fits the whole KDH “eat fire, hunt demons” vibe better than delicate shoyu broth ever could.

Second, let’s talk product placement.
It is canon (fight me) that the ramyeon in the KDH universe is Ottogi Jin Cup Ramyeon. This is not just a noodle cup—it’s the noodle cup. The cup itself has that distinctive wide paper design, unlike the US market styrofoam “Cup O’ Noodles” or Top Ramen cups. If you’ve ever tried to compare them, you know Ottogi Jin Cup has that glossy red/blue & yellow star design. Authentic. Original.

Third, corporate meddling alert.
Apparently Nongshim (yes, the Spicy Shin Ramyeon people) has secured the official KDH IP rights in Korea and has started pushing tie-in products. We’re talking Shin Ramyeon packs with KDH characters slapped on, ripping off the Ottogi design plus baked shrimp chips. Now—I have no beef with the shrimp chips (their shrimp chip is dominant for a reason), but the cup ramyeon optics are sus. Ottogi Jin has been the canonical ramyeon, and suddenly Nongshim is out here muscling in with licensing deals? It’s giving “rewrite for cash grab.”

It's been fun looking back at the rollercoaster that has been the T1 season up until this point, with a now more broadened view on the season. 

In rounds 1 & 2 (18 games) they went 11 & 7... and fans were losing their mind. Although they qualified for the “Road to MSI” people were concerned. They were not just losing to Gen.G, but they had lost to teams like Bro, DK, HLE, Nongshim. This was the defending Worlds Champions, and they were looking sloppy. Fuel to the fire was the constant shuffling of star ADC Gumayusi with Smash. The ADC that had won worlds, that had a synergy with Keria, that has performed well time and time again, was benched and switched, and essentially scapegoated multiple times. 

It was a true headache to witness.

There was fears this team would not make international tournaments with the way they were capping off their first half of the season and MSI looming ahead. In the final week they lost to HLE and Nongshim, 2-0, 2-0. Confidence from fans…shattered.

But this is T1, and whatever expectations you develop, flip them when it matters the most. Road to MSI, 3-1 KT, 3-0 HLE, and welcome to another international tournament for T1.

Okay fine, they’ve made it to MSI, however we have seen such a dip in form there’s no way they perform well against LPL teams and even Gen.G again. Well we got shown yet again why you honestly can’t doubt this team leading up to an international event, or even at it. 

3-2 against CFO…oh wait a minute, cracks in the glass. 3-0 Bilibili, oh wait yet again never mind. They have Gen.G though up next in the upper finals, and they slip in a 5 game BANGER of a match. This is the end for sure, Anyone’s Legend from the LPL was waiting for them, for a chance to knock them out. 3-2 victory for T1 and they’ve made yet another international final. 

They may have lost 3-2 to Gen.G but man did they just appear different than what we saw at the beginning of the season. Let’s get back to the LCK and see what happens. 

2-1 against Gen.G game one…woah. T1 honestly in the period upon returning to the LCK and Legends Group looked really good overall, with only a loss to Gen.G (twice) and KT. 

Worlds was on the horizon and we had to see what would happen with this roster, they’d have to win a few games and make their way to qualifying due to a tiebreaker that HLE won. 

The break before playoffs did NOT do T1 any favors, they had a horrible read on the meta, they were making strange draft decisions, and it lead to the sloppiest 3-2 victory over DK from the Rise Group. A 3-2 that was one blitzcrank hook away from not being in their favor. Then it was time for a familiar foe; HLE. A team that more recently they’d taken down multiple times. There was hope, and then it quickly vanished. HLE was prepared, working together, making the right calls, and genuinely dictating the game. It was a poor showing by the team, and the worry started to build about whether they would make Worlds.

But T1, being T1, will win a game with their backs against the wall and something on the line. Even if it means Oner goes absolutely berserk to win them the games. What an absolutely perfect performance from the Jungler in games 2,3,4. He was dictating the pace, he was making the right moves, he was setting up his teammates properly, and he was just phenomenal. This was a man that was not going to lose for any reason whatsoever.

Now they face Gen.G, win and avoid play-in, lose and have to face LPL 4th seed and still have a chance at missing Worlds.

The T1 rollercoaster has been in full force, but props to the players. They’ve been facing the utmost criticism constantly, and yet here they are with the chance to attend another international event (whether it is via play-ins or as the 3rd seed minimum). Guma has been under it the most, and yet he plays and performs when the time calls on him, alongside his teammates.

T1 fighting, and they remain fighting in the midst of a chaotic season that deserves all the credit of resilience. What do you think about their season up until this point?",,selftext,lck,willingtogame,17,17,0.9,0,False,False,True,False,,,Discussion,self.lck,1758303765.0,2025-09-19T17:42:45+00:00

>The first and fastest to cash in has been Nongshim.

>On Aug 29, the company released limited-edition Shin Ramyun instant cup noodles featuring the show’s main characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey.

>The product also mirrors the cup noodles shown at the start of the film, when the three Huntrix members slurp them down as they slay demons.

>All 6,000 cups sold out in just one minute and 40 seconds. Nongshim has since expanded the collaboration to include Wasabi Shrimp Crackers and Shin Ramyun packs.

>The partnership is making waves in the stock market too.

>Over the past week, Nongshim stock jumped 9.41 per cent, outpacing Samyang Foods which jumped 3.33 per cent and Ottogi which rose by 1.95 per cent.

>Analysts note it is unusual for Nongshim to outperform Samyang, which has been riding high on the global success of its Buldak noodles.

>**‘Soda Pop’ on cake**

>Food brands aren’t stopping at cup noodles.

>SPC Group’s Paris Baguette is also joining the craze. On Sept 12, it will release five new products inspired by the Netflix hit, including a Soda Pop Cake modeled after the Saja Boys’ debut performance and a Golden Butter Bun inspired by Huntrix.

>Other items include cheese bread with a message card from Derpy tiger, a persimmon-flavored pound cake drawn from the folktale about the tiger and persimmon, and Jeju mugwort omegi bread – all themed around the film.

>A second wave will arrive Sept 17 with a golden soboru bun, or streusel bread, themed after Huntrix as well as a red bean bun inspired by the three-eyed bird character, Seo-ssi.

>On Sept 24, another lineup of desserts, banana cakes, strawberry cakes, and cookies made with traditional Korean snacks will be launched.

>Paris Baguette will also deck out major stores, including its Incheon Airport branch, with KPop Demon Hunters-themed decor.",,selftext,KpopDemonhunters,escarzador,9,9,0.92,2,False,False,False,False,,,📰News📰,straitstimes.com,1757025129.0,2025-09-04T22:32:09+00:00

Analysts attribute the surge to growing expectations surrounding collaborations such as the Netflix animation \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim, once the leader in South Korea’s domestic ramen market, lost its position as the top ramen stock to Samyang Foods in May last year. While Nongshim’s stock price saw little movement, Samyang Foods’ shares soared, driven by its Buldak Ramen. At the shareholders’ meeting in March, complaints erupted: “A company’s competitiveness lies in its market capitalization, and Nongshim is lacking.”

Nongshim’s sluggish stock price began to rebound, riding on the popularity of \*KPop Demon Hunters\*. Reactions continued that the cup ramen and snacks featured in the series reminded viewers of Shin Ramyun and Shrimp Crackers. Nongshim confirmed the collaboration with Netflix, releasing limited-edition products featuring characters from \*KPop Demon Hunters\*.

Nongshim plans to sustain this momentum. The company has set specific targets: achieving sales of 7.3 trillion Korean won and an operating profit margin of 10% by 2030. It also aims to expand overseas sales to 61% of total revenue.

Nongshim has partnered with Netflix to release a product featuring characters from 'KPop Demon Hunters'. /Courtesy of Nongshim

I changed my mind about one and have some new ones.","My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/InstantRamen/comments/1l8kvu4/ive_finally_started_exploring_better_instant/  
  
At the time, I said that I didn't necessarily see the benefit of the ""premium"" ramens compared to the cheap Maruchan bricks I was used to. I also said the Nongshim Shin packets weren't good enough to replace the cheaper Maruchans.  
  
OK, I want to take the above back. Good thing Costco only sells the Shin packets in boxes of 18? Over time, the side-by-side comparision with a six-pack of Maruchan chicken packets won me over to the Shin. I don't actually mind the softer, thinner noodles from Maruchan, but when I ate enough, the depth of flavor in the Shin packets won me over.  
  
So, I tried three more flavors of instant noodle. I like to have five or six before I really feel like I know what I think. I've done that now!  
  
I got a 12-pack of **Kraft Mac & Cheese** microwaveable cups. ""Those aren't ramen!"" you say? Yes, but they are instant noodles and cheesy noodles seem popular in this subreddit. Well, I found something I like even less than the Maruchan Beef Cup Lunch. The cups come with not many noodles and a whole lot of thickener (cornstarch?) and a packet of cheese sauce mix. You microwave the noodles and thickener, then stir the gluey result. Add the sauce and mix: eat! Outside of the problem that I found the thickener leaves the noodles glued to the cup and difficult to stir, it seems to leave the cheese sauce tasting even worse to me. I'm sure I'm not the only one who grew up on Kraft's stovetop version. This one isn't even close to my memories—and when I was little we made it with *margarine*!  
  
Sure, packets are nice, but my store had only the big cups of **Nongshim Shin Black**, so I got them because they were also cheap! Definitely, the cup noodles can't match the packets of Shin I've been enjoying in terms of texture, but I wonder if the flavor is also compromised by the adaptation to a microwave cup? Because this variety is well-loved here and while I liked it, the flavor seemed not so great as it cooled and I began liking it less. I think I need to give Shin Black a fair chance and buy the packets sometime.  
  
My favorite of the three new-to-me varieties was one recommended my Marilyn Ong in her *Wirecutter* article. It's the **Lucky Me! Pancit Canton Kalamansi** noodles in packets. My main objection is that the packets are 60 grams (for comparison the Shin packets I have are 120 grams and the Maruchans are 85). Kalamansi, I've learned, is a citrus fruit based on a hybrid of kumquat and some other fruit, was developed in the Philippines, and is popular for cooking there! One thing I thought was interesting about the Pancit Canton noodles is that they are quite thin. I figured that the cup noodles are thin because of the challenge of heating them without a stove and that thinness made them too soft. I'm here to tell you: these thin noodles have a pleasing, firm, chewiness! This brand was also my first time with a noodle where you make the sauce in the bowl, then add the hot, drained noodles. I found the seasoned oil included in a packet to be unpleasant smelling and it remains funky even after mixing it with the liquid and powdered soup bases also included. But then you add the hot noodles and the odor goes away! And in that magical transformation, the sauce becomes savory, fruity, a little tart, and rich. Wow, I like this. My only real objection? Packets are too small!!! In the future, I may make them two at a time, but that might be too big?  
  
As I finish up these noodles, the next ones are ready to go in my cupboard (gotta finish off the Kraft Mac & Cheese and Nongshim Shin supply from Costco!). Next up, I'll try the Nissin RAOH Tonkotsu, A'Kuan Broad Noodle Sesame Paste Flavor, and Indomie Mi Goreng (the basic flavor).

Anyone else absolutely hate the changes to the noodles included in Nongshim Cup Ramen? I adore most if not all of the old versions of the ""no stove needed"" noodles (I reach for them on a busy day and I genuinely like them), but recent buys (post July) have these skinny ass round noodles that either is uncooked (on the top) or overcooked (if I wait for the top to finish); they sometimes don't even taste like wheat. The old one was twice as thick in a oval shape. I spied an insane discount at Costco on those plastic kimchi Nongshim Bowls, and one try made me finally understand why most of us go package. I loved them, and the new one made me return them. What the fuck. I thought it might just be the Americanized ones, but then I encountered it in the new Yukgaejang Cup. Thank god the soup was tolerable or I would have jumped off the cliff I was eating them in. If they change my beloved Oolongmen noodle, I might just. It's a blessing that I'm out of the country where I see them and cannot check. 

I'm guessing this may be cost cutting measure but honestly, Chinese instant noodles with the same shape tasted better, so that's no excuse. Even Mr Noodles have a bouncier bite.

# Ingredients for Homemade Shin Ramen Spice Mix

* **2 tbsp beef bone broth powder** (gives a rich, natural beef flavor, you can also use 2 tbs chicken bouillon, if you want it to taste exactly like Shin buy their chicken or **Beef Dasida Stock**)
* **3-4 tbs Gochugaru** (for heat and color, use 4 tbs for extra spicy)
* **2 tbs** **soy sauce powder** (as a substitute for hydrolyzed soy protein)
* **1 tbs** **dried mushroom seasoning** (provides umami depth)
* **1/2 tbs garlic powder**
* **1 /2 tbs onion powder**
* **1 tsp ground black pepper**
* **1 tsp ground ginger** (for warmth and depth)
* **1 tsp sea salt** (optional, to reduce sodium content)
* **1 tsp sugar** (optional, to balance out the spice and flavor, omit if you don’t need the sweetness)

The Prep: 

2 packs of Noodles and flakes go in this tupperware

Hot tap water eyeballed to be slightly above the noodles

Microwave 4 minutes (1000 watt microwave) 

Flip noodles and microwave 30 more seconds

Drain ""most"" of the water, eyeballed what looked like enough to make the sauce (and not turn it into broth)

Mixed in the powder base and oil packets, the sauce came out viscous and coated the noodles effectively. 

Taste test - slightly bland, added a light sprinkle of seasoned salt, helped balance flavor profile out effectively

Eat!

Right off the bat I can tell why this is such s divisive and controversial flavor. It is earthy with a hint of bitterness. These characteristics however, pair very nicely with the umami main show.

Something you always have at home. It's so common that we don't really have discussions or communities dedicated to it.

What's really surprising to me is seeing how popular Shin Ramyun is here. For decades, it's been the undisputed number one ramen in Korea, but I always thought it wasn't as well-known overseas. I thought Buldak was pretty much the only Korean ramen foreigners knew about, but looking at this community, I can see I was wrong.

And I wanted to share some of the other instant ramens that Koreans love. There are so many kinds—Yukgaejang, Neoguri, Twigim-Udon, Jjapagetti, Chamkkae Ramen, Moopama and more. Now that I think about it, almost all of these are Nongshim products. I guess a lot of Koreans' go-to ramens are from Nongshim.

Now what?  Rebound?,"  Good morning, everyone and I hope you are enjoying the little taste of autumn.  It is a wonderful 20.6c as I sit out here at the NekoDash Weather Center in beautiful northwest Yokohama, just waiting with anticipation for all the shenanigans the day job has in store for me today.

  But, before that, let’s talk weather.  Yes, we got cool weather and there is a lot of chatter, justifiably, talking about a rebound in daytime highs bouncing back to the lower-mid 30s.  Putting a little chart and data analysis behind this, I’m going to say that if you live in northern Japan down to around central Honshu, there will not be a significant rebound for at least 4-5 days.  Highs will stay in the upper 20s through the week.  Western Honshu and Shikoku as well, after a rainy Saturday afternoon tomorrow, will see high temperatures stabilize around 30 for most of the region.  Kyushu, however, came out on the short end of the stick this time.  From Fukuoka on down to Kagoshima, after a quick dip to highs of about 30-32 today and tomorrow, along with considerable rain chances on Saturday, daytime highs will edge up around 32-34 across the island.  

  The reason for this split is the jet stream, that band of high-altitude winds (about 10-15km above surface) that circle the planet.  The Asian jet stream will be bisecting Japan this week, allowing cooler winds over much of the nation, while cutting off Kyushu and largely leaving it to the tropic air mass to the south.  With no strong fronts or systems expected for the next 2-3 days, that means while those of us in Honshu, Shikoku and Hokkaido get some seasonal weather, Kyushu will get to join their spirit brother Okinawa in a celebration of an ongoing summer.

  Now, we urgently need to discuss the three active storms currently churning in the western Pacific.  Three.  That’s pretty impressive.  We have Typhoon 17 (known as Tropical Storm Mitag), then the former Invest 90W, which received a promotion to Tropical Storm 24W (Ragusa) yesterday, and it’s fraternal twin Tropical Storm 25W (Neoguri), which was the former Invest 91W.  With introductions out of the way, T17 (Tropical Storm Mitag) and TS24 are projected to move pretty much due west into the Asian mainland and won’t affect our weather in Japan at all.  T17 is doing that today, slamming into Hong Kong.  TS24W will follow soon thereafter.  It is TS25W that I am concerned about.  

  At the moment, TS25W doesn’t have a proper designation from the JMA.  It is a small bubble of trouble in the middle of the ocean, barely making a ripple, with only 64kph winds and a modestly central low pressure of 998 hPa.  But it has been flagged as a storm of interest and is expected to grow in strength considerably over the next 48 hours, attaining anticipated center winds of 140kph in the process, and receiving designation as a typhoon by both the JMA and the JTWS - the first storm of the season to be unambiguously named a typhoon by both agencies.  The soon-to-be Typhoon 19 is expected to track westward across the Pacific, gaining strength, ultimately bumping into the strong cool front we just encountered here in Japan yesterday.  This collision, which is expected to take place during the 23rd-24th next week is where the action will happen.

[Then as it begins its run into Japan.  Again, this is 9 days out.  We have even odds as to whether or not this scenario will play out.](https://preview.redd.it/h3fzcmxpl0qf1.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=193fdb2a1382caf5c71585f30f0a97b2634528c0)

  As things stand now, on Friday morning, the JMA, Weathernews and the US JTWC all pretty much call it quits for T19 at that point.  They have not forecasted any movement for the storm beyond the collision with the cool front.  However, the ECMWF, the European model, shows an interesting move in their long-range forecasts.  Now, this is going out almost 8 days, and accuracy of models tend to degrade horribly after 4-5 days, even with massive supercomputers at your disposal, but, the ECMWF shows T19 slipping around the cold front come the 24th, dipping south, getting re-energized, and then making a run for the Japan mainland next weekend, 27-28 Sep.  

 IF - and I cannot overstate what a big IF that is - IF that happens, T19 will be a very, very powerful storm indeed, and we would be hit with the strongest typhoon since T10 of last year.  

  Personally, I have a solid bias against models more than 5 days out because, at that point, the models are little more than a guess built on a guess, built on another guess.  But, here, I am willing to give it a look because the cold front - you know, the one that hit us just yesterday - will be in a weakened state by midweek, and probably will not be able to effectively steer the typhoon into the North Pacific.  

  At this point, I am not going to put all my money on that scenario, but I will be keeping an eye on it.  By, say, next Tuesday or so, we should be able to get a better grip on what moves, if any, T19 will pull around the front and we will keep you updated on that.",,selftext,japanweather,Neko_Dash,175,175,0.97,25,False,False,True,False,,,,self.japanweather,1758241405.0,2025-09-19T00:23:25+00:00

Environmental conditions remain highly favorable for further development and Humberto is expected to continue to strengthen until it becomes a strong Category 4 major hurricane on Sunday evening.  Humberto is currently moving west-northwestward, but will gradually gain latitude as it moves around the southwestern corner of a subtropical ridge positioned over the central Atlantic.  Humberto is likely to turn back toward the northeast on Tuesday and pass very closely to the west of Bermuda.

* [**14E: Narda**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1nn34p8/narda_14e_eastern_pacific_south_of_mexico/) — Narda has not undergone any significant changes in strength or structure as it continues west-northwestward across the open waters of the east-central Pacific this afternoon.  Environmental conditions will remain favorable enough to maintain the storm's strength through Saturday as it remains under the steering influence of a subtropical ridge to its north.  On Saturday, an upper low will dig into the western periphery of the subtropical ridge and weaken it, leaving an opening for Narda to abruptly turn north-northeastward toward unfavorably cool waters and a dry and stable environment which will rapidly weaken the storm until it degenerates into a remnant low on Monday.

## Western Pacific

* [**25W: Neoguri**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1nkc5xq/neoguri_25w_western_pacific_east_of_japan/) — Severe Tropical Storm Neoguri is maintained strength as it remains trapped between two competing subtropical ridges.  Although atmospheric conditions remain favorable for development and have even improved over the past several hours, with better upper-level divergence helping to expand the storm’s outflow, the storm’s quasi-stationary movement has caused cooler waters to upwell to the ocean surface, holding it back from restrengthening.  A shift in the position of the steering ridges is already taking place and will eventually nudge Neoguri onto a quicker northeastward track.  The storm will likely respond to this abrupt change in forward speed by restrengthening briefly into a typhoon; however, the storm will ultimately undergo extratropical transition over the weekend.
  
* [**26W: Bualoi**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1noz5ur/bualoi_26w_western_pacific_philippine_sea/) **(NEW POST)** — As Severe Tropical Storm Bualoi moves westward away from the Philippines this morning, it is gradually strengthening.  The storm is moving through a favorable environment and should undergo gradual to steady intensification as it crosses the South China Sea toward Vietnam on Sunday.  Bualoi is expected to make landfall on Sunday evening and rapidly weaken as it moves across Vietnam into northern Laos.

## Northern Atlantic

* [**09L: Nine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1nrclrs/09l_northern_atlantic_western_tropical_atlantic/) **(Potential cyclone)** **(NEW POST)** — Satellite imagery analysis and recent surface observations indicate that a tropical wave situated north of eastern Cuba is gradually consolidating and is developing a low-level circulation that has not yet completely closed.  Environmental conditions are generally favorable over the region; however, the disturbance’s development is currently being limited by land interaction with Cuba and by some southerly vertical wind shear.  As the disturbance moves north-northwestward away from Cuba, it is likely to become a tropical depression later this evening or early Saturday morning.  **The track and intensity forecasts remain highly uncertain due to a complex steering environment which also includes influence from nearby Hurricane Humberto.**

# Post-tropical cyclones
- - - 
Post-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.

## Northern Atlantic

* [**07L: Gabrielle**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1nr22y0/gabrielle_07l_northern_atlantic_northeastern/) **(NEW POST)** — Gabrielle has fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moves east-northeastward away from the Azores and nears the coast of Portugal on Saturday afternoon.  Although Gabrielle is currently producing storm-force winds, a sting jet could briefly bring it close to hurricane-force this evening.  Gabrielle will weaken substantially as it closes in on the coast on Sunday morning and will dissipate west of Gibraltar on Monday.

# Potential formation areas
- - - 
Potential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.

## Northern Indian

* **Area of potential development #1** (Arabian Sea)

* **Area of potential development #2** (Bay of Bengal)

## Western Pacific

* **Area of potential development #1** (Western Philippine Sea)

* **Area of potential development #2** (Eastern Philippine Sea)

I cleared the warning and put it on freeze boost for a bit, then put it at one level colder than recommended. I wasn’t sure if there was a lead time before another warning would prompt (if necessary), so today a few hours ago I shut the breaker off for about 30 seconds to “reboot” the fridge (and hopefully signal). It was perfectly fine and no warnings until maybe 3-4 hours later when I got the high temp warning again. 

It’s not filled more than normal, nothing warm was put in, and wire baskets are used for most items to prevent blocking the back or front air flow. I’m pretty sure none of the boxes are touching the back wall. 

Has anyone had this happen before? I haven’t opened the door much since the first warning to be cautious. Any suggestions to fix this? What are the odds it’s simply over-filled?

For context, starting maybe 2-3 months ago I noticed popsicles were a bit softer in that freezer than the ancient fridge-freezer upstairs so I’ve left it at one colder than recommended for a while. It was mostly where the Melona popsicles are that were softer, everything else was still firm and frozen (including the mini freezies at roughly same height as Melona’s but in the door).

Starkist’s are definitely my favorite so far, already made some hot sauce - amazing!

The malaysing yields a lot, but not as flavourful.

This has been a fun and wonderful experience over the last several years. Recently I experienced some burnout which I discussed with regular users and some of them recommended a sort of tip jar system [which I've since set up as an account on buymeacoffee.com](https://buymeacoffee.com/weeklygrocerydeallist). No one is ever obligated to pay money for this list. Worst case scenario I keep doing this for free for friends and family. Best case scenario I get a few extra bucks to purchase items on sale and can formulate some cool discount recipes each week that correlate to sales and help locals stretch some dollars and feed loved ones.

Last week someone pointed out there was a discrepancy in the mailer coupons for the Safeway in Mid Valley, which is what I base my list on, and the Safeway in PG. They were correct. There is a potential small store-to-store difference. These were not clipped coupons but sort of member specials. Honestly I can't keep track of that so we're going to presume that if the deals I list are slightly different than what you see I'm going to claim it's not my fault and that Safeway corporate is just misleading y'all.Let's move on.

----

**Safeway:** 4x reward point items denoted with asterisk (*). I should also note that Safeway has been promoting 2x reward point items and they are promising to lock pricing in for said things until December 31. I didn't take much notice of these until recently because they weren't that interesting. Some items as of late have changed my mind. I am temporarily denoting these things with double asterisks (**) and am hoping this doesn't mislead.

**Pork Shoulder Picnic Roast $1.99. Ok this is a big one. Earn 2x points from this item and it's price locked until December 30. 
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE INGREDIENT. Picnic Roast means it's bone-in (flavor++) but is also skin-on. Removing the skin takes a 
sharp knife and 10 minutes tops to remove. Everyone should be taking advantage of this. Pulled pork. Carnitas. Stews. It's a 
great value. I would love to share recipes for this sort of ingredient as it's so versatile and will feed SO MANY

I have previously flown with the Bumblebee/Starkist tuna packets (2.5 oz or so) and never had an issue in different airports. I would assume these would be the same but I would hate for them to get tossed if for some reason they’re deemed liquid (I’m flying only a carryon). 

Also- no, I will not be eating these on my flight. I’m not a monster.

This is one of those culture details that gets muddied in mainstream media, but it matters. Ramen and ramyeon may have originated in around the same time but preparation and taste are worlds apart—ramyeon is spicier, bolder, heartier, and honestly fits the whole KDH “eat fire, hunt demons” vibe better than delicate shoyu broth ever could.

Second, let’s talk product placement.
It is canon (fight me) that the ramyeon in the KDH universe is Ottogi Jin Cup Ramyeon. This is not just a noodle cup—it’s the noodle cup. The cup itself has that distinctive wide paper design, unlike the US market styrofoam “Cup O’ Noodles” or Top Ramen cups. If you’ve ever tried to compare them, you know Ottogi Jin Cup has that glossy red/blue & yellow star design. Authentic. Original.

Third, corporate meddling alert.
Apparently Nongshim (yes, the Spicy Shin Ramyeon people) has secured the official KDH IP rights in Korea and has started pushing tie-in products. We’re talking Shin Ramyeon packs with KDH characters slapped on, ripping off the Ottogi design plus baked shrimp chips. Now—I have no beef with the shrimp chips (their shrimp chip is dominant for a reason), but the cup ramyeon optics are sus. Ottogi Jin has been the canonical ramyeon, and suddenly Nongshim is out here muscling in with licensing deals? It’s giving “rewrite for cash grab.”

Spoiler: they weren't. I had no particular feelings towards Jin Ramen, but I loved Ottogi's Cheese Ramen, so when I saw the rebranded version of it, I decided to give it a try and compare the experience. 

[the package in question](https://preview.redd.it/labraigs7dpf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a590aa306c40dec338033490e012f9ee480307)

Well, I'll give it one thing - it certainly does *look* better than before. Sadly, that's it. The old Ottogi Cheese was salty, cheesy and a little spicy - just enough to keep things interesting. The new OTOKI Cheesy is just bland, not spicy at all and almost not even salty enough (and this is coming from someone who thinks Shin Ramyun is borderline too salty). A big hearty bowl of disappointment that was, but at least it looked pretty enough to take a picture.

###(Mei Suruga 🍎 & Baliyan Akki ♠️) 

###VS

###Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara 💃 & Erii Kanae 🎼

#[Comaneci, Erii!](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreias32vh347yahzyliefhd6vvsblsmfanzhhnl5yfes6mgrcajxnzu@jpeg)

The BestBros (**Baliyan Akki & Mei Suruga**) know how to open a show! *Considering the recent rise in mixed tag wrestling in America, look no further than these two.* A pair of rivals turned partners that always deliver the most spectacular bouts “Right There!”, this pair is a duo fantastic performers that bring the action regardless of match placement. Mei Suruga is a pin specialist and submission connoisseur (not to mention a total goblin) who is fresh off an awesome appearance with Uta Takami at TJPW. *Will we ever see Apple Ice Cream in ChocoPro?* Our beloved Apple Princess is unrivaled when it comes to the balance of tactics, technique, and innovation. Mei is incredibly gifted at pro-wrestling, undoubtedly destined for greatness in the Joshi scene. Meanwhile, Baliyan Akki is the Ace of the promotion: a dominant technician who excels at everything that is put in front of him (and is pretty ideal to face when getting back into the swing of things!). The way he strings techniques together is truly breath taking. Akki maintains an oppressive calm and presents himself like a champion even without a belt. The BestBros are one of the best pairs out there (even more so in the sacred ground of Ichigaya). With the former champs back on their winning ways, the future is bright. *But the near future might be full of comaneci and singing.*

“COMANECI!” **Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara** was actually the last tag partner **Erii Kanae** had in Ichigaya before her time off, so this is oddly nostalgic! The ageless fighter, mountaineer, and underrated photographer is a great support. Otoki is a straight forward combatant (with plenty of brutal attacks and bursts of speed) but also has a surprisingly sharp sense of humor! She is known for her hiking and heavy striking...but isn’t opposed to some slapstick (at the expense of her opponents). This dancing, kicking, Judo throwing, Showa Era fighter can go toe to toe with anyone put in front of her. Otoki has a killer style that utilizes a lot of her combat background, but she isn’t afraid of pulling out a classic cobra twist. As stated before, she’ll be pairing with “Opera House” Erii Kanae! The missing Doukie had been away for over half a year, but ChocoPro’s beloved songbird is thankfully back into the mix. This lime geared rookie batters foes with her shot put style strikes and excellent takedowns (as well as inspiring awe with her vocal skills!). The born entertainer’s ability to switch up her strategy is going to be a key feature in her growth. She’ll enchant you with her passion for wrestling just as easily as she does with that beautiful voice. Erii has promised to shine brighter than ever, so expect her to steal the spotlight! *Seriously check out her singing from the end of the Game Changer show, it was wonderful!*

###Team Hiyori (Sayaka 👗 & Hiyori Yawata ☁️)

###VS

###Kaho Hiromi ⛵  & Chie Koishikawa 🏵️

#[Wild Combo](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreigkyrl6qkrhcnsr7kow5sii6owe2eoh4qpdbfbh57of2v3k65ff3m@jpeg)

Asia Dream Tag Team Champion **Sayaka** is always looking for another target for her wrath. Pair that with the clever scheming ascension of **Hiyori Yawata** and you’ve got a deadly combination. While she is known for her unsettling quotes, “Smiling Violence” Sayaka is more associated with her explosive striking power. Those extremely loud forearms and pinpoint dropkicks devastate everyone equally. It is no wonder that she is one of the pillars of the promotion. Sayaka’s unnerving cheerfulness while she does brutal things provides her with a frightening presence in ChocoPro. After all, she’s “happy to beat someone”! Her growing ferocity lately is really adding to that awesome aura. Expect a lot of shocking blows! Speaking of shocking: Artistic Cloud Girl Hiyori consistently impresses with her growing skill, magnetic personality, and ruthless ambition. Her tactical innovation (including when she weaponizes her own gear), natural gift for wrestling, and that growing arsenal of great moves make her a must watch talent. She gets the small stuff in between that is hard to teach...and has a willingness to get the win by any means necessary! Can the Pom-Pom tactician and Leader of Team Hiyori find a way to steal the spotlight once more? Will these two be able to get along? Will Hiyori somehow try to turn this into a tag title shot for herself? *Special note: Any team featuring Hiyori is by default considered Team Hiyori due to her presence, though Sayaka might claim otherwise.*

Say ""Happy Smile""! This marks the first time **Kaho Hiromi** and **Chie Koishikawa** have teamed up outside of DPW! Kaho, as the youngest rookie, has had a rough go of it from the very start...but she has been able to navigate everything thrown at her with a sharp wrestling mind and a cheery attitude. She has already had a lot of big moments in ChocoPro, and her potential is limitless. Kaho is one of the best new prospects of the promotion: this quick and clever “weakling” might just be a prodigy at pro-wrestling. Widely regarded as one of Ichigaya’s brightest up-and-comers, Kaho has a unique approach to the basics coupled with clever transitional setups to make up for her lack of size and power. She comes up with new stuff every single match! While Chie has her outmatched in several categories, Kaho is a quick learner and will do her best to aid her senior. Chie Koishikawa has endless energy, boundless potential, and a destiny beyond what any of us can fathom. Her charisma is unquestionable, the Frantic Fencer warming the hearts of fans across the world with her emotional outbursts and flashy style. The drama she brings is really next level (even in Janken after the show)! *Seriously though, if you are a new viewer be sure to check out how wildly expressive she is at all times.* Her desire is rock solid and her passion burns bright. This time, the girl with “Too Much Energy” will be helping her youthful junior, providing her with an increased pace, alternative strikes, and a lot of tag specialization. The shark girl is going to show her wealth of experience and the many lessons she can impart in overall style...this time from on the same team!

###Makoto 💜

###VS

###Miya Yotsuba 🍀

#[Miya Three](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreifq2p7lhgkhzsj7sfpymqx7txcgkbgqbyqmto6hqseo2ghc2gtgei@jpeg)

Who better to help Miya celebrate her three years of wrestling than the doll-like destroyer, **Makoto**? Makoto is imposing, elegant, and overwhelmingly intense. The veteran is usually asserting her beautiful dominance alongside her like-minded junior, but this time we’ll be treated to a rare Makoto’s singles match in Ichigaya (quite the gift for Miya!). Her eye-catching fierce style and incredible presence make it hard to look away. The graceful fighter is one of Emi Sakura's (and Tajiri's) veteran students, known for her poise, presentation, and shocking brutality. Makoto brings with her the legacy of the Queen: she is deceptively strong and unmercifully vicious whenever she needs to be. Her charming demeanor and effortless grace make a good dichotomy to the brutal onslaught she brings to the ring, it can be pretty alarming how easily she switches modes! Good luck, Miya...

**Miya Yotsuba** has gotten so awesome at pro-wrestling in only three years. Preparing her hammer strikes to take on Makoto’s deadly kicks, Lucky Charm Miya will be aiming to bring down the veteran with critical hits! Stepping into the Square for this celebration with that sharp new look, Miya is out to prove that she hasn’t lost sight of the top! She brings a brilliant all-out attack style that delivers absolutely raw intensity. Her bone-rattling back-breakers and the thunderous Miya Hammer leave no question of her destructive power. Carrying the name of the Four Leaf Clover, Miya shares a strong bond with the fans and has her sights set on more than just championships: she’s aiming to rise as the new Ace of ChocoPro. The passionate clover tends to charge directly at any adversity with a smoldering resolve (and a lot of heavy damage!). While she looks to mark this milestone with a big win, can Miya stand tall and shake the heavens by bringing down one of the champs? *Here’s to another year of excellent Lucky Destruction!*

**[If you’d like to support Masa Takanashi’s recovery journey, here is a link to the gofundme and the explanation!](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-masa-takanashis-recovery-journey)**

*ChocoPro Wrestling is a free online & promotion (that also runs ticketed live in ring shows) run by AEW's Emi Sakura, that often takes place in the legendary Ichigaya Chocolate Square! It features a steady pace of Episode releases, fan interaction, long story arcs, and much more! A place where the turnbuckles are replaced with 14th floor windows, the ropes are replaced with fans, unforgiving walls provide creative avenues for skills otherwise unthinkable, and you can take solace in knowing that the referees usually do nothing. While it might be a shocking change at first, the intensity and storytelling will leave you wanting more. Think of it like the Hart Dungeon but as a promotion, if that helps!

###Weaklings (Kaho Hiromi ⛵ & Hiyori Yawata ☁️) & Everett Connors 💔 VS Popcorn Carnival (Chie Koishikawa 🏵️ & Sayaka Obihiro 💙) & Erii Kanae 🎼 VS Shin Dragon (Shin Suzuki 🍙 & Choun Shiryu 🐉) & Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara 💃

#[Trio of Trios](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreidxo6bxd52usqd7nw5rduzgijztr6xtktiifo7u23l6swhoh3dy7y@jpeg)

They'll be facing the rookies that turn weakness into strength...the Weaklings (**Hiyori Yawata & Kaho Hiromi**), who are this time joined by the athletic & aesthetic support of **Everett Connors**! *Is he an honorary Weakling?* A secret genius and amazing shirt designer, Hiyori Yawata is the first half of the cheese-themed rookies. Artistic Cloud Girl Hiyori consistently impresses with her growing skill, warm attitude, and plucky spirit. That is because her tactical innovation (including when she weaponizes her own gear), natural gift for wrestling, and that growing arsenal of great moves make her a must watch talent. She is one of the prospects in the scene to definitely keep an eye on, because she gets the small stuff in between that is hard to teach...and has a willingness to get the win by any means necessary! She’ll be joined once again by the latest prodigy of ChocoPro Wrestling, Kaho Hiromi! The Sailboat is a quick and tactical student that astounds all manner of wrestling fans with her sheer creativity. She has a unique approach to the basics coupled with clever transitional setups to make up for her lack of size and power. She might just shock you with some of her alternative methods! These two have actually started busting out some fun tag combinations and strategies, but how will they incorporate Everett Connors into their shenanigans? Connors, who loves ChocoPro with all his heart, finally made his debut in the previous episode...and now is getting his first ChocoPro in ring show! The chill fashion icon & known heart-throb high flyer is a well-rounded wrestler with a strong focus on fundamentals & entertainment. He’s got some pretty great gear theming ideas (and creates them himself like Hiyori!). This colorful daredevil fits right in with the ChocoPro gang. He’s effortlessly cool, beloved by everyone everywhere he goes (though I've heard he doesn't get along with his Grandma...), and brings a true authenticity to everything he does in the ring (and out). Also he does Cute on Purpose style posing, so he's bound to be a hit with the usual audience. *While I struggle whether to call the Weaklings “Weakies” or “Yowatchies”, Akki calls them Weaklings so that is how I’ll refer to them from now on.*

The Carnival continues! The former tag champs known as Popcorn Carnival have been reunited following Chie's time off. Don’t worry, they still possess that supernatural chemistry and that remarkable fire! Baseballer **Sayaka Obihiro** and “Too Much Energy” **Chie Koishikawa** have amazing synergy paired with uncontrolled charisma. Brave Fencer Chie is a magnetic personality...but even more so with her Hero, Mentor, and the wild Soul of ChocoPro: the Battle Chef, Obi! This team is a fun mix of the backhanded fencing chops of shark girl Chie and the devastating heavy strikes (including throat thrusts) of “Sprint” Obihiro. Chie's extreme speed, technical counters, and trick pins are complimented by Obi’s almost magic movement and flowing pinning style. The raw emotion these two can display is overwhelming! They are loud, energetic, out of control, and back together. This time the Carnival will be bolstered by the joyous return of the “Opera House” **Erii Kanae**! The missing Doukie had been away for over half a year, but ChocoPro’s beloved songbird is thankfully back into the mix. This lime geared rookie batters foes with her shot put style strikes and excellent takedowns (as well as inspiring awe with her vocal skills!). The born entertainer’s ability to switch up her strategy is going to be a key feature in her growth. She’ll enchant you with her passion for wrestling just as easily as she does with that beautiful voice. Erii has promised to shine brighter than ever, so expect her to steal the spotlight!

Shin Dragon, **Choun Shiryu & Shin Suzuki**, aren’t worried about the wild nature of a three way trios bout! As Choun would say, “So what”!? Can their synchronized warfare bring order to the chaos? Choun, as the Dragon of ChocoPro, is an action hero come to life. He has done some of the most spectacular acts in Ichigaya with his fantastic signature Jackie Chan inspired flair! He is easily one of the most intense forces in the promotion. This Kung Fu master utilizes a truly unique fighting style, pulling off comedic and agile stunts you’ll not find elsewhere. There is a reason he has held every belt in ChocoPro! His extremely versatile partner Shin is no slouch either, they’re a unique pair of combat acrobats. Shin’s fiery spirit and intense athleticism fit well with the general vibe of ChocoPro...and honestly, his knack for dealing with kids (as a proud father) comes in handy due to all the goblins and monsters. Shin’s strong sense of balance, precision, and timing make him a natural spectacle. We haven’t even seen his full technical ability, but he delivers the goods with a crispness and consistency that will have you craving more. Shin’s strong grasp of the fundamentals and Choun’s unorthodox approach combined to form an incredible pairing. *Shin will be having his own produced show for his 10th year on the 13th, “Steel Heart Run”!* He’ll be joined this time by fellow hiking enthusiast: the ageless fighter known as **Tokiko “Otoki” Kirihara**! Mountaineer and underrated photographer Otoki is a straight forward combatant (with plenty of brutal attacks and bursts of speed) but also has a surprisingly sharp sense of humor! She is known for her hiking and heavy striking...but isn’t opposed to some slapstick (at the expense of her opponents). This dancing, kicking, Judo throwing, Showa Era fighter can go toe to toe with anyone put in front of her. Otoki has a killer style that utilizes a lot of her combat background, but she isn’t afraid of pulling out a classic cobra twist. Watch out for that slick Comaneci pin as well! Who will climb to the top of this chaotic Trio of Trios?

###Sayaka 👗 & Charli Evans 💘

###VS

###MiyaSOY (Miya Yotsuba 🍀 & SOY 🐸)

#[Destruction](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreibcgug4uh6mm3ejthce7mtuzodnpzwe27pw2cb3tqirxp43tol52m@jpeg)

One half of the Asia Dream Tag Champs, Smiling Violence **Sayaka**, has become quite the tag specialist. Not only has she developed a talent for team attacks and coordination overall, but she will probably show off her popular mean streak. After all, she’s always happy to “beat someone”. Even though she’s got great pins and submissions herself, it is those ungodly strikes that the crowd loves the most. *It is even what she does in the ChocoPro mobile game!* Sayaka’s elbows sound like cannons, with her unwavering cheery demeanor only adding to the fear she inspires. Who will be the next challenger for the unstoppable Bellflowers? Expect the champ to judge everyone in this bout. She’ll be teaming up with the world traveling part of the extended ChocoPro family, **Charli Evans**! Shin-Kiba will become Chevs Country next! The vegan Violence Artist has been indirectly part of the ChocoVerse for a long time, but the second half of Medusa Complex usually has to support from afar. Absolutely dripping with charisma and equipped with a range of skills perfectly suited for ChocoPro (intergender and hardcore!), Chevs has got it all (she’s even a multi-talented content creator). Beyond just the intensity she brings, her move set is flashy and super devastating! She’ll be delivering her own hard hits coupled with that versatility the Australian All-rounder is known for. If you’ve never seen Charli wrestle, there is no one like her. Also check out her matches with Kanji when you get an opportunity! *Chevs tends to pair up with the most destructive members of the roster!*

Stepping into the ring with that sharp new ‘Black Clover’ look, **Miya Yotsuba** is out to prove that Ichigaya’s Lucky Charm hasn’t lost sight of the top! Miya brings a brilliant all-out attack style that delivers absolutely raw intensity. Her bone-rattling back-breakers and the thunderous Miya Hammer leave no question of her destructive power, despite her short career. Carrying the name of the Four Leaf Clover, Miya shares a strong bond with the fans and has her sights set on more than just championships: she’s aiming to rise as the new Ace of ChocoPro. The passionate clover will be supported by her fierce and joyful partner: the Jumpsuit Powerhouse **SOY**! The iron-willed frog from Pro-Wrestling Evolution might not have the top belt from her home promotion just yet, but she does have her own sick new set of gear! *Also, SOY really does seem to inherit traits from both Yoneyama and Sakura.* She’ll be leaning on her heavy striking and powerful throws to support her fierce partner. Fortunately, SOY continues to refine her technique with a speed and precision that feels remarkable. On top of that, she carries a natural, heartfelt warmth that makes her so easy to root for. Don't underestimate her though, the Blue Frog means business. MiyaSOY's dreams of tag gold are re-igniting and these two are ready to get back on that track. Taking on the devastating tag champ is one thing, but Charli will present these two with a lot of new experiences (in the pain department). Good luck, MiyaSOY! (MiyaSOY!) 

###Baliyan Akki ♠️

###VS

###Antonio Honda 🍯

#[Game Theory](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreihbxf2tli2kfhwrhaq7fqe4whrcgf6idpwew6hew7qeeqk7dn425q@jpeg)

Ichigaya’s own Ring General (or maybe Square General?), **Baliyan Akki**, is usually the difficult side of a singles match, but this time the elite technician might have a puzzle of his own to solve. Akki has never bested Anton on his own, which is an amazing statistic! Expect him to still dazzle with his smooth flowing style while he tries to outsmart the honey-loving storyteller. ChocoPro’s Ace is defined by pinpoint precision in his strikes, endless creativity that blends total mastery of the basics with a deep hunger for innovation, and a confident yet effortlessly easygoing demeanor. He carries himself with the aura of a champion, even without a belt. How can this wrestling expert stay so humble? A once in a lifetime talent, definitely living up to his moniker of “One in a Billion”! Sporting not only great hair but unmatched wrestling skill, Akki stands as a true figurehead of the promotion. The Ace of ChocoPro will be looking to once again prove something to his veteran opponent, while keeping his focus on the results of the main event...

A lover of honey will be blessing us with a rare singles bout! **Antonio Honda** matches are out there, even for the usual ChocoPro episode. This wily veteran is a comedy mastermind that rewrites the rules of reality...and actually has a stellar singles record in the promotion! When he isn't singing a song or calling forth an Ancient Fox Spirit, he is performing cruel pranks and slapstick that pairs nicely with his old school wrestling references. The idea of using retired wrestlers abilities is a lot of fun. ChocoPro has also yet to see the lowest depths of Anton’s arsenal (and the lengths he will go to in order to secure victory!). It cannot be overstated how difficult it is to face Anton alone. Considering the stakes involved for Akki, expect this one to be either very silly, very brutal...or more likely a lot of both. *We might even see an even rarer appearance by Gon the Fox!*

###SOS 🆘 (Tsutomu Osugi & Banana Senga) & Hagane Shinno ⚔️

###VS

###Ichikawa Shōnen Gurentai (Munetatsu Nakamura 🥔 & Shota Kawakami 🧣)  & Chris Brookes 🐙

#[Killer Speed](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreidsuirp2my3bxcsgfb2b6l6n7efjrweoe2vu7nl6ryl5p2s6zrgha@jpeg)

Sending an SOS to the world, Speed of Sounds (**Tsutomu Osugi & Banana Senga**) returns to ChocoPro Wrestling! With usual appearances at ChocoPro aligned promotions such as Michinoku Pro & BASARA, this incredible team of speedsters (hence the name) brings an electric pace and powerful synergy to the table. The frantic tag combinations and surprising intensity will keep you hankering for more. (Lucha infused puro style is always a blast!) Though under varying aliases, these two have actually been at it together for twenty years! Osugi (one of Skayde’s golden boys) & Senga (always great to have more fruit themed folks) are great wrestlers individually, but when paired become a criminally underrated well oiled machine. How will these two veterans modify their excellent formula this time for the ChocoPro style? Hopefully we get many more appearances for this killer team. *It should be noted, despite this match being in a ring, these two are no strangers to no-ring shows...Imagine them in Ichigaya! (Hopefully I get to write about them individually as well, soon!)* Speaking of killers, Cold Killer **Hagane Shinno** will be as frigid as ever (and not just in his icy attitude). This absolutely brutal striker has been nearly invincible in the series so far and isn’t afraid to unleash hell! His solemn ferocity makes him an instant favorite among new fans (with Hagane surprising most with his exceptional technical skill, emotionless fury, and explosive fighting style) while his byronic nature pairs well with his eccentricities. Emi Sakura asked Hagane to step up in this chaotic era, which led to a lot more appearances by the mysterious striker. How will his cold ferocity blend with the hot intensity of SOS?

Their opponents start with the pair of two childhood friends known as “Ichikawa Shōnen Gurentai”: GanPro’s **Munetatsu Nakamura & Shota Kawakami**! These “young thugs” might be referencing Kishiwada Shōnen Gurentai with this name, which is pretty cool. Mune impresses greatly in every appearance no matter the opponent. This stylish young blood of GanPro is rising through the ranks of the scene. The Promotion's rebellious spirit further tempers his intense mat skill and technical speed. Adding his fierce resolve, growing mastery across the board, and a clever wrestling mind, Mune has really become quite captivating. He’ll be reinforced by his partner Shota Kawakami’s youthful drive. This loud and wild rookie of GanPro has made many ChocoPro appearances and is working hard to catch up to Mune! Picking fights with a burning desire, Shota is always prepared to take some risks in order to secure a win. He’s got a killer look, flashy flying strikes, and fluid movement for someone so fresh! Don’t ever count out the hot-blooded underdogs of Team GanPro. They’ll be backed up by another with experience against SOS, Tsundere Submission Specialist **Chris Brookes**! While he might be known for ""Death by Roll-Up"", Brookes tends to introduce opponents to their end via devastating maneuvers or ungodly tap outs. Chrissy B will be looking to dish out his usual brutal strikes and gnarly limb traps while remaining extremely fashionable. *He would probably make a pretty good team with Everett Connors, now that I think about it*. While he might not have the fancy DDT belt anymore (for now!), this excellent technician will provide shocking violence and smooth fundamentals as he always does for ChocoPro. His vast versatility and explosive ability will come in handy in the chaos of the trios match! Plus it will be interesting to see how these three get along, considering how much Chrissy B tends to bully young rookies... *Chrissy B needs to appear more often! Also he needs to take on ZSJ at Ultimate Party 2025, so this will be good practice.* 

###Mei Suruga 🍎 (c)

###VS

###Rina Yamashita 🐘

#[SUPER ASIA CHAMPIONSHIP](https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:zthpb4ef6yrc3oq2xkhqprzx/bafkreidengmtayn66ie3whcge44tyc3v46spu5ig2o25qbji7ltgak5x4y@jpeg)

Nine challengers have attempted to seize the Big Blue Belt from **Mei Suruga**, but the Apple Girl still stands proudly as our Super Asia Champion! ChocoPro's genius debuted just 21 days after beginning her training. This was only the first of many amazing details of this true prodigy! She's got absolutely unmatched instincts and a truly divine flair for the art of wrestling. The Apple Movie Star has been redefining every aspect of pro-wrestling while aiming to be the best in the world (and making a strong argument for that in every match). It makes sense, because ChocoPro’s Goblin Princess is basically unrivaled when it comes to tactics, technique, and innovation...and has no ceiling in sight. The intensely charismatic Red Fairy of Ichigaya goes by many names, but no matter if you know her as the Apple Goblin, Big Apple Girl, Teacher in Darejyo, or a BestBro...Mei Suruga is unquestionably the top of the promotion! Her goblin reputation is well earned: biting opponents, uncanny versatility, and showing total ruthlessness when necessary...but it’s hard to hold it against her when she’s this exceptional. Mei is pound for pound one of the best wrestlers out there, rivaling even the Ace in consistent match quality, and she elevates everyone she faces to her stellar level. She has had a lot of thrilling defenses so far, with her fantastic reign producing some of the best match ups the promotion has ever seen. This time a brutal juggernaut has come to challenge for her beloved belt, another inevitable battle as Rina is one of Mei's many rivals from the past. Even Rina will need to dig deep however, because the undaunted Red Devil thrives under pressure. Each time she somehow reaches another new level we didn’t even know existed. No matter the challenger, no matter the stage, Mei shatters expectations every time. Now standing at the very top, she’s ready to defend her crown with every ounce of her goblin grit and supreme skill. She isn’t just a champion: she’s a phenomenon. As always: no matter what happens, Mei Suruga has proven that she is skilled beyond our wildest dreams...and very much deserves her position at the peak of the mountain. The Apple Girl was born to wrestle, she is the cornerstone of ChocoPro Wrestling, and absolutely embodies the Throne of Super Asia...and will prove that once again. 

Cue the terrifying boss music! The Game Changer has finally come, whether as the show itself or the frightening challenge before Mei. “Broken Dumptruck” **Rina Yamashita** rampaged through Ichigaya on her path toward the Big Blue Belt! Known as the Deathmatch Amazoness, Rina is a force of nature in both the Japanese and American independent scene (especially in GCW, she was Ultraviolent Champion for almost 800 days!), a merciless specialist in hardcore warfare and a credible threat to absolutely anyone who stands in her way. One of the coolest wrestlers in the world, she's tough as nails and will shatter you like glass. *There is a reason she won over the American Deathmatch fans so easily.* Every appearance feels like an explosion, with her wild power and sheer brutality leaving only wreckage behind. She radiates an intimidating aura, balancing a fierce, killer presence with an undeniable charisma that draws you in even as it terrifies you. While Mei has faced violence before, this challenger lives and breathes it. Even outside the realm of deathmatches, Rina brings a radically different style for Mei, a test unlike any before. Whether as a “Rebel”, “Unchained”, or even living “Mi Vida Loca”, this total badass will be a new nightmare for the Super Asia Champ. Can Mei Suruga keep her dream intact? Rina Yamashita steps into the ring with one mission: to take the Super Asia Championship from Mei Suruga. She vows to put EVERYTHING on the line to take the belt. More than that, she has come to challenge Mei Suruga’s “pro-wrestling”. Will the Apple Girl be able to withstand her vicious onslaught? 

**Until next time!** 

*ChocoPro Wrestling is a free online & promotion (that also runs ticketed live in ring shows) run by AEW's Emi Sakura, that often takes place in the legendary Ichigaya Chocolate Square! It features a steady pace of Episode releases, fan interaction, long story arcs, and much more! A place where the turnbuckles are replaced with 14th floor windows, the ropes are replaced with fans, unforgiving walls provide creative avenues for skills otherwise unthinkable, and you can take solace in knowing that the referees usually do nothing. While it might be a shocking change at first, the intensity and storytelling will leave you wanting more. Think of it like the Hart Dungeon but as a promotion, if that helps!

Nice flavor tho if you have spice tolerance","Overall a fairly standard Korean-style spicy soup, with the flavor profile you'd expect from a Korean-style spicy soup (Otoki Jin Spicy is crying in a corner). I genuinely don't remember how this differs from the Paldo Hwa, which was also a spicy Korean-style soup. Maybe this one is a little more ""fuller"" in flavor, beyond the spiciness? 

Speaking of which, this spiciness has me waiting inbetween bites as I'm typing, it's very reminiscent of the fiery, somewhat stinging spiciness of the Shin Super Spicy. In fact that's the only one I recall in the soups that had this kind of stinging. 

It isn't bad by any means, but it's a little bit stronger than what I tend to choose by default. In fact, the Shin Super Spicy people will rejoice that now they can try a contender and see which is better. 

Overall, the more I got used to the spice levels, the better the flavor became, honestly. It's really a ""what you expect from a Korean spicy soup"" flavor.

Well, I'll give it one thing - it certainly does *look* better than before. Sadly, that's it. The old Ottogi Cheese was salty, cheesy and a little spicy - just enough to keep things interesting. The new OTOKI Cheesy is just bland, not spicy at all and almost not even salty enough (and this is coming from someone who thinks Shin Ramyun is borderline too salty). A big hearty bowl of disappointment that was, but at least it looked pretty enough to take a picture.

Good thing I have the things that I need to return said flavor. 

So what I did was that I added an extra small spoon of dashida (in retrospect, a little less would have been enough, but I didn't know yet I'd add Ajinomoto chicken), 

then found I should also add a bit of Ajinomoto chicken powder, and for added flavor some extra Maggi würze (those ribonucleotids help add some kick).

 And eventually I found that I should also add a few drops of Ottogi Brown Rice Vinegar (don't use regular vinegar, use some kind of rice vinegar).

 With that, the flavor has returned and I got a nice enjoyable soup, a bit spicy but overall pleasant. Instead of rice vinegar, I could have used kimchi.

Day 1 - I reached Seoul, and had issue with getting into to my hanok guesthouse accommodation. Anyways the whole thing was messed up, and no one got back to me on how to check in, and owner went uncontactable. No choice, I had to book another proper hotel then. And I had to haul my luggage everywhere I go on that day 😑

Meanwhile while trying to settle the accommodation, I went for a makeup and photoshoot session. Had always wanted to try korean makeup style, and I am no expert in makeup. Booked with LeeJ studio, and their partner for makeup and hair. I would say - at the salon - do be ready for some gentle upselling of hair services :). I splurged.

Photoshoot was interesting - first time doing too. The photographer was good at giving instructions to follow and he took some really nice shots I don't think I had ever seen myself be like. I bought a few more extra photos outside of my package. (50k won per extra photos). Cant wait for the final pics!

Didn't managed to get to the food places I wanted to try that day :( 

Day 2: get to Sokcho, and hike Seoraksan. Will have 1 night in Sokcho.

Not sure how to buy the ticket from the machine, as it keeps rejecting my credit card. Had to ask someone to help me with the purchase.

I stayed at Sokcho Station hostel. It's clean and tidy! Good breakfast at Cinnabon. Highly recommended! And it was also walking distance to the centre area too. 
First, went for some Abalone and seafood soup, before heading for Seoraksan. 

Honestly I didn't do much research, and was using Naver to mark visitor centre to get off the bus. Turns out it's way too early to get off the bus to Seoraksan. Should have sat all the way until it reached the last stop - so I took another 30mins to walk to the entrance. Did the Ulsanbawi trail - which was about 4h+ roundtrip. The last leg into the mountain was the toughest, with all the rocky path and stairs. Bring good shoes, I went in with sneakers😅. And bring knee guard if you need. I was sort of rushing out a little because I do want to get out before the sunsets and it becomes dark. 

Day 3: did sunrise at Sokcho, which was a fail with all the clouds. Then a 40mins walk in the Abai region. Then took a bus to Gapyeong where I will stay 1 night as well.

Gapyeong - I was most excited for this! Wanted to go to the water park (Gapyeong Ppaji) and do a solo BBQ at the pension I booked with. I booked the pension on nd209.net! 

Sadly when I reached the water park via taxi, it was like unmanned and no one was around. It was pretty isolated, and I hate to be stranded here not knowing what to do. I hopped back to into the taxi and decided to do shopping for BBQ groceries instead. I felt so regretful about this :( 

But oh well, nothing beats a grocery shopping experience. About 47k won for 
- 2 platter of meat (hanwoo and pork), 
- some mushroom, 
- an onion, 
- mozzarella cheese, 
- veggies for wraps,
- small kimchi pack, 
- garlic, 
- 2 canned drinks, 
- a makgeolli,
- an ice cream, 
- a seaweed pack
- soba buckwheat ramyeon

Was thinking if this would work because: I don't have any condiments - and I didn't want to splurge on them just for 1 cooking session. But it's still an experience! 

I did my jacuzzi experience in my room (yes they have a tub!) and was fully recharged. Then contacted my pension manager for the BBQ setup - which the manager said she will give me as service awww ❤️!

Day 3: After morning checkout, I am back to Seoul for the last part of my trip. 

Had a funny moment at the train station, I chased after a guy who dropped his jacket, and next (literally) second someone chased after me for my passport which I dropped. What an amazing sequence of event 🤣 

And the train ticket purchase was the confusing part too: they don't accept international credit card, I was panicking to quickly purchase a ticket for the next train. I couldn't find the ticket counter, and had to ask a Korean couple to help me buy while I will pay them via cash. They rejected my cash, and just purchased my tickets for me!!! Omg... I can't ever feel so grateful to the local generosity! 

So back to Seoul - first place to go: jjimjilbang at Insadong. Its 15k won per entrance for sauna and bathhouse, but it seems rather small, and I think touristy as well? I might have only spotted tourists using this facility. 😅 Still! I rather quite enjoy it - especially the salt sauna in the common area.

Finally made it to one of my food itinerary at 3dae samgyejangin for ginseng chicken soup. But along the walk there I spotted a Gwanghwamun Mijin outlet - it wasn't in my plan to go, but I would visit here tmr instead! 

Anyways back to the ginseng soup - I would say it is too different from the usual soup kind. Would not recommend this place until you had at least tried the original soup elsewhere. This one would be more for the adventurous ones.

Afterwards it was just shopping at one-too-many olive young outlets. Non-stop.

Day 4:
Majang meat market for hanwoo - there was a guy at the market who so excitedly beckons out to me. So i decided to buy from him. 🤣. Got rib-eye (240gm) and strip loin (170gm) ~ 79k won, and some extra brisket on service.

The guy at the restaurant who helped me with the charcoal stove also helped me with cutting up the rib-eye, and teaching me how to enjoy it - apparently there is a sequence to which part on the rib-eye to enjoy first because of the fats positioning. 

During cooking and eating, need to do it slowly because the charcoal fire might suddenly be huge and you need to keep flipping or taking the meat away. Mine was very much well-done 😅 
 
Next, visited skincare clinic for some booster shots. Rejuran Eye and Juvelook at Toxnfill. The prices I feel are good. I had done Rejuran via machine back at home and it wasn't too bad. But this round I shall instead try hand injection for both. The injection pain was still bearable. Feels like pin-prick into the skin ouch.

Shopped around Gangnam afterwards. Then decided to go Gwanghwa Mijin at Seocho for dinner was and it was a long detour: but it didn't disappoint, I felt wow-ed by it. Highly recommend a visit here - especially after a bbq lunch. :). 

Did something silly again, forgot to check the route properly on Naver, and I sat through the metro green line from Seocho to Euljiro 3. It's a damn long journey. And I was already half way through before I realised this - too late and didn't make sense to switch the metro already.

Day 5: last day rush for shopping at Starfield Coex, Mangwon market, shopping at Hongdae. Also a planned snacks shopping at Lotte Mart at Seoul Station. 

Gosh that last snack shopping threw me off because it was an off day for Lotte Mart at Seoul station? Now I really returned home without much snacks to share with family and friends. 

All in all, I splurged on lot of skincare such that I really wonder how long will it take for me to finish them 🤣 it's such a trap! But I can't stop myself from going into all Olive Young and pharmacy outlets. The last few days in Seoul were quite a blur to me, I felt like I wanted to accomplish more shopping but didn't managed to buy much of fashion stuff. The fashion are either too expensive, or too young/cute/vintage for me

Food wise, regrettably, I really wished I had some kimchi pancakes, jjajangmyeon, BBQ eel, tangsuyuk, tripes to complete the experience. But there's only so much of a stomach that I have. I need to be back again :)",,selftext,koreatravel,Character_Rub8286,25,25,0.93,8,False,False,True,False,,,Trip Report,self.koreatravel,1757578108.0,2025-09-11T08:08:28+00:00

Thought this tuna would taste gross just like all other brands out there and would need to mix in at least 2 full light mayo and season it up to make it creamy.

Guys, the flavor is a complete game changer. 120 cal per serving which is half a can with 16g proteins approximately. I could have eaten full can, but wanted to save up my calories budget for the dinner.

Also, not in the title, but Nama Chocolate (Royce) - Japanese fudgy chocolate can also be a low calorie sweet treat if you consume 2 pieces instead of full serving size of 5 pieces. The pieces are so rich and fudgy that 2 small pieces is completely enough to satisfy a sweet tooth after savory meal.

My boyfriend really likes the sauce, so I tried to remake it just for him. This is my best attempt at recreating the sauce that comes in the Bibigo Chicken & Vegetable Steamed Dumplings:

Makes about 2 tbsp (about the same amount as the sauce packet):

- 1 tsp Kikkoman Sushi & Sashimi Soy Sauce
- 1 tsp Kikkoman Aji-Mirin Sweet Cooking Rice Seasoning
- 1/3 tsp Kikkoman Traditionally Brewed Soy Sauce (original (red) or less sodium (green) both work; alternatively use any dark soy sauce)
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- 1 tsp water
- 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
- 5 drops Kikkoman Rice Vinegar (the regular one (green), not the seasoned version (pink) or the sweet version; start with 3 drops and add to taste)
- 1/3 tsp pure sesame oil (not roasted sesame oil)
- ⅓-1 tsp grated raw onion (sweet onion / yellow onion / white onion)
- the tiniest amount of a green Thai chili pepper de-seeded and mashed with a mortar and pestle (alternatively use any green chili pepper but only use 1/3 of a pinky or less. Or more if you want it more spicy)

Notes:
- Sauce ingredients do not need to be cooked, just mixed together.
- Sushi soy sauce is soy sauce boiled and with mirin and sake already added.
- I used Kikkoman brand for most things as that's what's mostly accessible.
- Pure sesame oil > roasted because roasted sesame oil's flavour is too overpowering for a sauce.
- Key components that bring the sauce next level are the rice vinegar, grated raw onion, and green chili pepper paste. The ingredients list at the back of the box lists onion extract and green chili puree, so yeah, if it doesn't have those things, it's not gonna taste the same.
- Original doesn't have rice vinegar (uses white vinegar only) but I don't know, I had to use rice vinegar to get the same brightness as the Bibigo sauce. Somehow white vinegar isn't sour enough. Rice vinegar brings it from 60% of the way there to 80% easily.
- Onion brings it from 80% to 95%.
- Green chili pepper paste makes it nearly exactly the same (99%) but so much effort for the faintest tingle on the tongue -_- I admit it adds flavour but the onion carries in that department honestly.

Perfect thing about making your own is that you can customize it exactly to your liking. If you don't like it as bright/sour as the original, then omit rice vinegar. If you hate even the tiniest bit of spice, omit the green chili pepper. However, this is about the furthest I recommend customizing it if you still want it close to the Bibigo (grated onion is essential but can adjust the amount).

One fascinating aspect of the Chinese prepared foods industry is how it's making regional specialties accessible nationwide and beyond.

## Current Success Stories

**Lanzhou Beef Noodles (兰州牛肉面)**
- Traditional: Required 16-hour bone broth preparation
- Prepared version: Ready in 5 minutes with separated fresh noodles
- Available in major Asian markets through brands like Uni-President

**Xiaolongbao (小笼包)**
- Traditional: Expert pleating technique, precise soup-to-meat ratio
- Prepared version: Flash-frozen with soup perfectly preserved
- Brands like Bibigo and Wan Chai Ferry offer retail versions

**Sichuan Hotpot (四川火锅)**
- Traditional: Complex spice mixture, hard-to-find ingredients
- Prepared version: Pre-portioned bases with authentic Pixian doubanjiang
- Haidilao's retail line reported 4 billion RMB in 2023 sales

## The Wish List Discussion

I'm curious - what Chinese dishes have you always wanted to try or cook but found too complex? Here's what's trending on Chinese food forums:

1. **Peking Duck (北京烤鸭)** - The skin crispiness challenge
2. **Dim Sum Variety Packs** - Restaurant-quality har gow and siu mai
3. **Regional Breakfast Foods** - Jianbing, youtiao, cifantuan
4. **Festival Foods** - Zongzi, mooncakes with modern fillings

## The Innovation Pipeline

The complete guide to the German general staff for Demokratische Union enjoyers!,"Greetings fellow democracy fans! 

Do you enjoy playing the German Empire? 

Can you overlook the colonialism and generally retrograde disposition of the German political system, society at large and the imperialism that characterizes the country? 

You just can't get immersed when you know that some of those dudes pulling off encirclements were stinky N*zis OTL, that are probably executing the encircled troops?

There must be a way to solve this inherent contradiction! Well, now you can! Introducing: The German general tier list!

We will rank the German generals according to the patented *I googled this shit for a few hours*™ technology! 

Let us begin by saying this, however: as far as I'm concerned, almost all of these men are either war criminals or butchers of humans, both the ones under their command and the ones they are killing. They are not good people, war is bad(so brave!) and military achievements belong in these games and the dustbin of history, the people that start wars are all demons and should be boiled.

Alright, now onto the tier list! We're going from ""Just following orders"" to ""War criminals"" and onto the ""Should be summarily shot"". Notice how none of the tiers are ""good""? Exactly.

#TL;DR:

""Just following orders"": Curt Haase, Erwin von Witzleben, Friedrich Paulus, Gotthard Heinrici, Rupprecht von Bayern * , Alfred von Vollard-Bockelberg * , Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord * , Werner von Blomberg * , Werner von Fritsch #, Ludwig Beck #, Walther Wever #, Manfred von Richthofen #, Ernst Volckheim, Erich von Bonin * , Franz von Bayern*, Georg Wetzell #, Hugo Sperrle #.

War criminals: Albert Kesselring, Eberhard von Mackensen, Erich Hoepner * *, Ewald von Kleist * *, Fedor von Bock, Georg von Küchler, Günther von Kluge, Maximilian von Weichs, Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, Walter Model, Wilhelm List, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Gerd von Rundstedt, Walther von Brauchitsch #, Kurt Student, Hermann Balck, Eugen Ritter von Schobert *.

Should be summarily shot: Franz Halder * * *, Hermann Hoth, Walter von Reichenau, Heinz Guderian * * *, Erich von Manstein * * * , Robert Ritter von Greim #.

The reason I split off ""Should be summarily shot"" and ""War criminals"" isn't that the war criminals are any better, but that those under them don't even deserve a trial with how fucking evil they were, it would be a waste of oxygen to allow them to lie in court.

 # : These are staff officers in game. Beck was a shithead but he was sidelined prior to the war. The Red Baron obviously died in The Great War, but he was apolitical up to his death, Wever died in 1936, von Fritsch was killed in Poland just 21 days into the war. Wetzell was too old for the war. Sperrle was twice acquitted for war crimes.

\* : von Schobert died 3 months into Barbarossa, ~~but I couldn't find evidence of him participating in war crimes up to that point~~, EDIT: it has been pointed out in the comments that he did participate in war crimes. Rupprecht von Bayern was obviously too old for the war, but the family was against the N\*zis and his wife and children were imprisoned and moved around concentration camps. Von Vollard-Bockelberg was on the older side and was discharged in 1940. Von Hammerstein-Equord was one of the few officers that did everything in his power to stop H\*tler, even fraternized with trade unionists, but was a close friend to Schleicher which prevents him from being the one ""good"" guy. Blomberg is very lucky he was sidelined in 1938, as he was an ardent supporter of the n\*zis. Franz von Bayern was too old to serve. Von Bonin was a staff officer and too old to serve.

\* * : If you want to rehabilitate these men in your head cannon there is a bit of wiggle room for that. I wouldn't though. Hoepner was part of the July 20th Plot and resisted the mistreatment of POWs in Poland. He only committed war crimes in the Soviet Union in pursuit of the war of extermination, it is possible that a sane regime would prevent him from this. Von Kleist was pretty pragmatic, he's the reason Germany recruited so many collaborators and he protected some Mizrahi Jews.

\* * * : Franz Halder, Erich von Manstein and Heinz ""I invented everything"" Guderian are the primary architects of the ""Clean Wehrmacht"" myth(I'd call it disinformation campaign). These men were criminals and their self-serving lies poisoned our historiography for decades. Halder not only issued the war of extermination decree, he was also incredibly incompetent, his actions directly sabotaged Germany's war effort by shifting focus away from the oil fields of Maikop, Grozny and Baku, redirecting reinforcements and materiel towards the Moscow axis. That's the only good thing that can be said about him: his incompetence hastened the defeat of Germany.

Before Conquest, Nidhogg was my client's first pick to fight against the Red Baron. 

Most of the design is mine, with my client's ideas being that he should have axes with saw like features that he uses to knaw on Yggdrasil. The other idea was to include Yggdrasil roots and dragon/serpent like patterns on his clothing. 

With that I decided to cover him in actual roots, covering the axes as well, giving his clothing scales and fur to make it stand out, with the addition of piercings not just on his face but also his arms I hope I gave him a serpentine like appearance.

I have already presented researches about the Saturn-Neptune cycle, for example explaining how it can be related to the diffusion of Gnostic Ideas in modern culture as well as the development of Quantum Mechanics (if you are interested, it is available on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advancedastrology/comments/1gw8kvc/the_saturnneptune_cycle_gnostic_ideas_in_modern/) or on my [blog](https://astraclavis.substack.com/p/the-saturn-neptune-cycle-gnostic)).

As Saturn can be symbolically associated with what structures or limits, and Neptune with that which dissolves, it would make sense that the UFO phenomenon, which represents something from out of this world but also vague in nature, could be linked to it as well. UFO related events blur the frontier of what is commonly accepted as the concrete, basic, reality.

The following is the result of searching whether or not a correlation could be found between the Saturn-Neptune Cycle and the UFO Phenomenon.

As to provide a “stricter” investigation, only the years where the major aspects took place are taken into account. When a specific date for the event is available I have added the orb of the aspect. In some cases when the event is dated but the orb is too large I don’t specify it but as the event could be of interest I still kept it in the list. I consider this research as en entry point and admit that it could be expanded and further detailed.

Also, for readability purposes, the events listed are just a fraction of what could be found.

It is important to mention that it seems like other cycles could be involved. For example, the Uranus Synodic cycle in some instances or planetary conjunctions with the Nodes. I have yet to delve more precisely into those in order to be able to confirm it completely (or not).

I won’t enter into a debate regarding the reality of the phenomenon and its nature (or motives), but to simplify the subject we could say that there are four main hypothesis :

* UFOs are from Extraterrestrial origin.
* UFOs are Man made.
* UFOs are of Extradimensional origin (a lot of specificities could be added for that idea, of course).
* A mix of the three previous points. And when we say “mix” it does not only mean that the three possibilities can coexist at the same time but also that there are bridges, blends, influences, links, between the three, which highly complicates the understanding of what we are confronted with.

Would it be possible, using Astrology, to have a better idea of what type of case we are observing at a given moment ? Well, I started noticing certain patterns when the “experience” seemed more likely to involve some form of human participation but, once again, I still need to do more research to propose a solid hypothesis.

This post is divided into three sections : the first one presents “modern” and “well known” events related to the phenomenon, the second part presents some of “ancient” dated events as well as old artistic representations that could be linked to the UFO idea, and the last section is a short reflection on the matter and a possible forecast for the near future.

# Modern Era Events (1900-2026)

While the events listed may seem random for a lot of people who are not familiar with the UFO lore, a lot of these are major and usually recognized as “stepping stones” in the development of the phenomenon. Also, it is not a US-centered list.

**Conjunctions**

https://preview.redd.it/aa4uelyp5epf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3ff4db3a2919159e3fbecd57d930a5258f4d14

1. **Saturn-Neptune conjunction of 1917**, exact on August 01st 1917 at 04°45 Leo :
   * ***Fatima Marian apparitions*** : While Catholics consider this case as Marian miracles, from my perspective and research, various elements seem to point towards a UFO-related phenomenon. I won’t enter into the debate about the exact nature of the events, but I suggest everyone curious to look into it, it is a fascinating case. To briefly resume : Over the course of 1917, three Portuguese shepherd children had visions/encounters with a being that ended up being associated with the Virgin Mary ; she would appear to them specifically on the 13th of each month between May and October 1917. What is said to be the Virgin, delivered a series of messages about World events to come as well as three secrets to the children and announced that she will perform a miracle on October 13th 1917. On that day, around 100 000 people gathered in Fatima and many saw what was designated as “The Miracle of the Sun” where, among other things, some people described seeing a spinning disc (that they would say was the Sun itself) emanating multicolored lights and making some form of dance in the Sky.
   * ***The Red Baron*** : The German pilot, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron was a fighter who became famous for shooting down 80 enemy planes for Germany during WWI. During the spring of 1917, while he was flying over Belgium he saw a “looking like an upside down silver saucer with orange lights” that he eventually shot down. Even weirder is that another witness, also a German Air Force ace that was present, reported to have seen two little baldheaded entities get out of the crashed machine and ran away.
2. **Saturn-Neptune conjunctions of 1952-1953**, exact on November 21st 1952 at 22°46 Libra, May 17th 1953 at 21°38 Libra and July 22nd 1953 at 21°12 Libra :
   * ***Washington Incident*** **\[\~5° orb\]** : In July 1952, Washington DC experienced an incredible amount of UFO sightings, most of them gathered around July 19th-20th and July 26th-27th. During this period only, the US Air Force received over 717 new reports, while the four precedent years had accumulated 615 UFO reports.
   * ***Project Blue Book*** : In 1952 was launched the Project Blue Book which was a systematic study of UFOs by the US Air Force that lasted until 1969. It collected 12618 UFO reports out of which 701 were classified as unexplained.
   * The Project Blue Book director, Edward J. Ruppelt mentioned : “During a six-month period in 1952, 148 of the nation’s leading newspapers carried a total of over 16 000 items about flying saucer.” All the 1952 year seem to have been a major peak period of UFO observations.
3. S**aturn-Neptune conjunctions of 1989**, exact on March 3rd 1989 at 11°54 Capricorn, June 24th 1989 at 11°14 Capricorn, and November 13th 1989 at 10°21 Capricorn :
   * ***Belgian Wave*** **\[\~1° orb\]** : In 1989 started what is known as the Belgian UFO Wave which lasted up until 1991. The day with the most known observations seem to be November 29th 1989, a bit after the last exact conjunction. Most of the observations mention a black triangle flying object with 4 spotlights. Some of these observations were directly done by the police, others were correlated with radar traces and various times F-16 planes were sent for interception.
   * ***Ucanca gathering*** **\[0° orb\]** : On the very same day the second conjunction of 1989 took place, June 24th, around 40 000 people gathered in Tenerife (Canary Islands) on the Ucanca Valley. The director and host of a program on the RNE (Spain national radio) decided to organized a direct there because he was convinced that a contact was going to take place. In the months prior, he started to received from different sources messages that a contact was about to happen. While no major event happened, the date chosen is stunning.
4. **Saturn-Neptune conjunction of 2026**, exact on February 20th 2026 at 00°45 Aries :
   * *See end of post.*

**Sextiles**

https://preview.redd.it/p7j9ibmt5epf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a10c4e73e5ca09ef198652798e58345e47e52fc2

1. **Saturn-Neptune sextile of 1912**, exact on April 26th 1912 at 21°06 Taurus-Cancer :
   * ***Titanic Observations*** **\[\~1° orb\]** : A few days prior to the sextile being exact, occurred the famous sinking of the Titanic. A not so well known fact, is that several survivors reported seeing strange lights in the sky when they were on lifeboats.
   * ***Sheerness Incident*** **\[\~7° orb\]** : On October 14th 1912, at Sheerness, England, many witnesses saw or heard a kind of light/aircraft that sounded like an engine, moving over the town. The incident was so significant that it prompted questions in the House of Commons. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, launched what could be considered the first government inquiry into UFO sighting. He stated :”I have caused inquiries to be made and have ascertained that an unknown aircraft was heard over Sheerness \[…\]. Flares were lighted at Eastchurch, but the aircraft did not make a landing. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate the nationality of the aircraft”.
2. **Saturn-Neptune sextiles of 1922-1923**, exact on December 11th 1922 at 18°03 Libra-Leo, April 26th 1923 at 15°23 Libra-Leo, September 14th 1923 at 19°06 Libra-Leo :
   * For this sextiles I did not find sufficiently sourced events.
3. **Saturn-Neptune sextile of 1947**, exact on July 1st 1947 at 08°03 Leo-Libra :
   * ***Kenneth Arnold Sighting*** **\[<1° orb\]** : Probably one of the most famous cases. On June 24th 1947, a few days before the sextile went exact, pilot Kenneth Arnold saw nine shiny disk-like objects flying at incredible speed near Mount Rainer, Washington. He described their movement as “like saucers skipping on water” which led the press to coin the term “flying saucers”.
   * ***Roswell Incident*** **\[<1° orb\]** : A few days after the sextile went exact, the US military recovered “an object” from a ranch near Roswell. The first announcement made by the US Army was that it was a “flying disc” but then retracted the next day by saying that it was a conventional weather balloon. Of course, since then a lot has been said and imagined about what really happened at that moment but it would be too long to expose all the theories surrounding this impactful event.
4. **Saturn-Neptune sextiles of 1959**, exact on March 21st 1959 at 06°30 Capricorn-Scorpio, June 17th 1959 at 04°24 Capricorn-Scorpio, December 23rd 1959 at 08°29 Capricorn-Scorpio :
   * ***Dyatlov Pass Incident*** **\[\~3° orb\]** : While not exactly tied to the “classic“ UFO lore, there is nonetheless the presence of “bright flying spheres” in some reports. On February 2nd 1959 nine experienced hikers died mysteriously at the Dyatlov Pass, in the Ural Mountains of Russia. Overnight, something caused them to get out of their tent and flee the camp without proper equipment. Not all seem to have died in the same manner, some were killed by physical trauma, others from hypothermia, some bodies had missing eyes or tongue or even eyebrows. The conclusion of the investigation was “a compelling natural force” caused their deaths.
5. **Saturn-Neptune sextiles of 1982-1983**, exact on October 14th 1982 at 24°41 Libra-Sagittarius, June 7th 1983 at 28°10 Libra-Sagittarius, June 21st 1983 at 27°47 Libra-Sagittarius :
   * ***Soviet Nuclear Base Incident*** : In October 1982, multiple UFOs were reported to have performed maneuvers above nuclear missile silos at a Soviet ICBM base. Allegedly, the launch sequences of the missiles were activated and could not be stopped which caused great panic as it would mean the start of WWIII. Shortly after the UFOs left and systems functioned correctly again.
   * ***Morenão Stadium Incident*** **\[\~5° orb\]** : On March 6th 1982, during a major soccer match, several players, referees and over 24000 spectators witnessed multiple flying objects in the sky.
   * ***Hudson Valley Wave*** : In 1982 started the Hudson Valley UFO Wave which lasted until 1986. Thousands of people reported seeing triangular objects with bright multicolored lights.
6. **Saturn-Neptune sextiles of 1995-1996**, exact on June 27th 1995 at 24°41 Pisces-Capricorn, August 17th 1995 at 23°22 Pisces-Capricorn, March 15th 1996 at 27°12 Pisces-Capricorn :
   * ***Varginha Incident*** **\[\~4° orb\]** : Known as the “Brazilian Roswell”, this case involves a lot of elements from the UFO lore and is hard to summarize in a few lines without missing fascinating pieces. On January 20th 1996, residents of Varginha, Brazil, reported seeing a UFO crash and to have close contact with alleged extraterrestrial beings (and even capturing them). Some reports indicate that the government recovered debris and beings as well. There also seem to have been unexplained animal deaths at the local zoo around the same time.
7. **Saturn-Neptune sextiles of 2019**, exact on January 31st 2019 at 14°54 Capricorn-Pisces, June 18th 2019 at 18°43 Capricorn-Pisces, November 9th 2019 at 16°01 Capricorn-Pisces :
   * ***Surge in US Sightings*** : The US National UFO Reporting Center recorded 5971 UFO sightings, almost double the count from the previous year.
   * ***USS Omaha UFO Swarm*** **\[<1° orb\]** : Between June and July 2019, the USS Omaha and nearby Navy vessels reported multiple encounters with UFOs. Specifically on July 15th 2019, the USS Omaha was swarmed by up to 14 objects. The incident involved radar confirmation, visual sightings and video recordings.
   * ***Navy Acknowledgement of UFO Videos*** **\[\~3° orb\]** : On September 18th 2019, the US Navy officially confirmed that three leaked videos showing UFOs were authentic, marking a historic shift in official narrative around the UFO phenomenon.
   * ***Storm Area 51*** **\[<1° orb and \~3° orb\]** : On June 27th 2018 an event was created on Facebook to storm the Area 51 and over 2 million people responded “going”. On September 20th 2019, about 150 people showed up at Area 51.

   * ***The Maitland Wave*** : During the Summer of 1926, there were a series of reports from Maitland, Canada, mentioning silent, moving lights that emitted “searchlight-like” beams sweeping the ground.
   * ***Lancashire Humanoids*** : In November 1926, in Lancashire, England, a young boy who was playing hide-and-seek, made an encounter with “three strangely clad figures” who seemed to be trying to look inside of a house. Each of them were wearing a kind of “bulky suit made from silver-grey tubes” and had a “transparent dome-like helmet” on their heads. He tried to remain quiet and unseen but suddenly the figures turned back and he would describe their heads as being “shaped like lightbulbs” also with large dark eyes and extremely small noses.
   * ***Himalaya Expedition*** : A famous explorer at that time, Nicholas Roerich, reported seeing a shiny oval object in the sky while crossing the Himalayan Mountains, in August 1926.
3. **Saturn-Neptune squares of 1944-1945**, exact on July 2nd 1944 at 01°34 Cancer-Libra, January 8th 1945 at 06°25 Cancer-Libra, April 6th 1945 at 04°45 Cancer-Libra :
   * ***Foo Fighters*** : During the second part of the year 1944, Allied aircraft crews began massively reporting unexplained lights and glowing orbs following them and able to easily out-maneuver them. Pilots called them “foo fighters” and thought they could have been secret enemy weapons.
   * ***Trinity UFO Crash*** : In August 1945, shortly after the first atomic bomb test, near the site in New Mexico, two boys and their family witnessed the crash of an “avocado-shaped” object with non-human occupants in it.
4. **Saturn-Neptune square of 1963**, exact on February 18th 1963 at 15°39 Aquarius-Scorpio :
   * ***Charlottesville Missile Site Alert*** **\[\~1° orb\]** : On February 5th 1963, intermittent yellow-white glowing objects were reported hovering over a missile site in Virginia, USA. The same day, a private pilot in Washington DC also saw a pulsating yellow-white light maneuver around its plane.
   * ***Asunción Encounter*** : A student in Asunción, Paraguay, saw an object land on the school grounds and there were also sightings by residents, which included an official of the Ministry of the Interior, of a high speed flying over in over Asunción.
   * ***USS Roosevelt Incident*** **\[\~2° orb\]** : On October 2nd 1963, a high altitude radar tracked object started getting close to the ship and moving erratically, F-4 Phantom jets were scrambled. After hovering nearby, the object departed suddenly. This event involved multiple trained observers and radar confirmation.
5. **Saturn-Neptune squares of 1979-1980**, exact on September 14th 1979 at 17°47 Virgo-Sagittarius, March 26th 1980 at 21° Virgo-Sagittarius, June 22nd 1980 at 21°00 Virgo-Sagittarius :
   * ***Manises Incident*** **\[\~5° orb\]** : On November 11th 1979, a commercial flight of a Spanish company with 109 passengers on board was forced to make an emergency landing at the Manises’ airport in Valencia, Spain.

When the pilot got close enough the electronic flight systems were scrambled. The incident had so much public reach that the Spanish Parliament got involved. Though, it was dismissed and considered as some optical illusions. It is probably one of the most famous cases in Spain’s UFO history.
   * ***Rendlesham Forest Incident*** : Often referred to as “The British Roswell”, the event took place in December of 1980 and the witnesses were US military personnel.

# Ancient Cases and Art Representations

Here is a very short list of past events and paintings that could be associated with the UFO phenomenon if considering a modern lens.

***Livy’s Chronicles (-173)***

There are multiple examples in Titus Livius historical records of strange sights in the sky. For 173 BC, he mention “at Lanuvium a spectacle of a great fleet was said to have been seen in the sky”.

In 173 BC, there were a Saturn-Neptune square (Cancer-Libra).

***Obsequens’ Chronicles (-154)***

Here is a comment from Julius Obsequens when reporting an event from 154 BC : “at Compsa weapons (*arma*) appeared flying in the sky”. Richard Stothers, from which this example and the previous one are taken in a compilation he made of Antiquity UFO-like events, states : “The term refers to defensive weapons, especially shields”.

In 154 BC, there were two Saturn-Neptune squares (Pisces-Sagittarius).

***Plutarch’s Testimony (-74)***

In 74 BCE, Plutarch of Chaeronea wrote about huge and alight objects in the sky during the battle between the armies of Lukulus and Mithridates VI, in Asia. He detailed that they were “wine vessel shaped” and silver color.

That year, -74, an opposition between Saturn and Neptune occurred (Sagittarius-Gemini).

***The Annunciation with Saint Emidius (1486) by Carlo Crivelli***

https://preview.redd.it/2a8hb0j56epf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa27b777d94ee9b2367ea0a0eb9946f302597868

This painting is an artistic depiction of the Annunciation (the moment the archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary that, through a virgin birth, she will conceive and become the mother of the Messiah). On the forefront are represented Gabriel and Saint Emidius, the woman on the right is the Virgin Mary.

The ray of light coming from the circular cloud is supposed to mean the Holy Spirit.

Some modern commentators see in this “cloud” something akin to a UFO. While it may not have been the intention of the painter and while the painting does not represent an actual event witnessed, it is nonetheless curious to observe that this painting was done in 1486, the year of a Saturn-Neptune conjunction in Sagittarius.

***Basel Celestial Phenomenon (1566)***

https://preview.redd.it/b58w9b786epf1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c314ca1e09891b23c12317d41f6a133e67ac939

This pamphlet page of 1566 describes numerous red and black balls in the sky before the Sun rising that seem to have “fought” against each other over the sky of Basel, Switzerland.

Between 1566 and 1567 there were three exact squares between Saturn and Neptune (Virgo-Gemini)

***Utsuro-bune, 虚舟 (1803)***

Utsuro-bune, literally “the hollow boat”, is the name given to an unknown object depicted in a Japanese legend, which is said to have happened in 1803 and was later published in 11 documents across the 19th Century. The story is about fishermen who saw a young woman with red hair abroad this “ship” which drifted ashore the eastern coast of Japan.

Here are some of the drawings made at that time :

This year, 1803, there was an exact sextile between Saturn and Neptune (Virgo-Scorpio).

# Reflections & Near Future

The next Saturn-Neptune conjunction will occur in 2026, exactly on February 20th.

Given the narrative that is currently unfolding and what has been presented in this post, it seems highly probable that (a) significant event(s) related to the UFO phenomenon will happen within the next months or in the next year.

While it could be a great news for all the UFO/ET enthusiasts as well as people in general, I would like to invite those who will be reading this to be cautious about it and to take what will be shown with a bit of distance. Indeed, it seems like a context is being purposely prepared and there might be some nefarious interest behind it. A complex mix of reality and lies to deceive the masses and to serve those who control (or wish to) them is a possibility.

The phenomenon has always shown some hybrid aspects and the idea or theory that we might have been manipulated in some form or another since millennia in that regard can’t be fully discarded.

Also, the Saturn-Neptune conjunction in Aries, will be receiving a sextile from both Pluto and Uranus which might be indicative of a Scientific paradigmatic shift and/or a seize of power through technological means or seize of technological power. This specific configuration will be explored in more detail (and for other contexts) in an upcoming post I have been working on.",,selftext,Advancedastrology,Penitent17,114,114,0.98,95,False,False,True,False,,,Mundane,self.Advancedastrology,1757969679.0,2025-09-15T20:54:39+00:00

Feel free to disagree with some placements,.

""Skill Issue"" Uh YEAH! I'm a COD buns boi that loves his FPS and Naughty Dog games. My best friend reached out to me to play this game again and I still suck. It's fun because of how dicey it is but damn does it kick my ass. 

My number favorite unit without a doubt is Eric. He's just so HIM. Jaha and Tyrin should be swapped.

I had the most fun leveling up Kazin. Something about him leveling up just gives me great joy in life

My main class: Jace(Bowie),Eric,May,Peter,Kazin,Karna,Tyrin,Jaha,Gerhalt,Lemon and Slade. My most useful units that help me the most are May, Eric and Jaha. I stopped using Slade after the Geshep fight. Jaha killed the most bosses for me. Kazin clutched the Red Baron fight. Gerhalt CARRIED the chess fight(Jfc that shit sucked).

My sub class(Before I got comfortable): Jace,Sarah,Chester,Jaha,Kiwi,Elric,May,Eric,Peter,Rick,Slade and Gerhalt. The ones I didn't main either weren't helping me as much, eating damage before landing attacks or just a burden. It sucked kicking Sarah and Rick out because they were actually PRETTY decent. Elric was honestly okay but I saw May as the superior archer and if I need someone for distance. May was my girl. Elric had better distance coverage for attacking enemies but bro fumbled on 2 big occasions for me to keep him.

Promoted: Jace/Bowie-Hero(Level 27),Jaha-Baron(Level 26),Kazin-Wizard(Level 29),Slade-Ninja(Level 24),May(Level 31),Gerhalt-Wold Baron(Level 22) kept him to Zeon fight due to bias,Rick-Paladin(Level 15) I had him as Pegasus in my 3rd playthrough but he sold,Elric-Sniper,MY GOAT Eric-Pegasus(Level 33) killed the most enemies,Karna-Master Monk(Level 25),Tyrin-Wizard(Level 27) Sorcerer was ass in past playthroughs. Just barely any damage with the spells. Taya was fine but I used her for two matches and said nah.

No hate to the bottom 3. I just either never them or see them better than any other units use at the moment. Kiwi took forever for me to level up before I sacked him. Claude is a tier above for power but his shit movements is a weakness for me. Same thing with Zynk. Higgins is decent, I just see Eric superior. Randolf is actually a genius unit if you use him right and position him correctly, he was so good I stopped using him in this playthrough since he cheesed so many of the enemies. He's in B for low defense but my god is he a clutch king since he's the perfect set up for an enemy to be killed by shaving off half their health. Definitely a borderline A. Taya is a pity B since the few times I used her she was a good distraction for the enemies, her spells just don't do enough damage. Wizard>Sorcerers all day. Nothing much to say on Chaz and Freyja(is that his name?). They're not terrible but definitely are surpassed by other units in their group which explains(Karna>Sarah and Eric>Rick>Chester). My opinion on Jace/Bowie? He's Claude from GTA 3 except more badass and HIM, he killed Kraken,Tartos and Zeon for me. Lemon killed Odd Eye. Slade cooked Cameela.

Luke,Janet and Screech are RNG hell. They are so unlucky for me it's ridiculous. I really tried with Luke but nah bro kept selling. Screech did a lot of damage at the right times but would die immediately after. They really fall under the ""Strong Unit but shit execution by the game design"". Claude and Kiwi deal good damage but suffer from horrendous movement. Jaro and Chester are glass cannons, they fold under 2 or 3 attacks but deal considerable damage with certain units. Subbing Chester out was a pain since he actually helped me clutch my first playthrough

Sheela and Jaro aren't bad, I just don't see them as main stays. Gyan is fine, he just comes too late in the game when I already find the class I want.

Hope you're all having a great start to your week!

First of all, I was taken aback by last week's post reception (so many comments, damn!), but this is what I like about Dandadan. That we can have discussions and be civilized about it. You guys are awesome in that regard!

Also, to the mod who pinned the post: Thank you. Questionable decision, but thank you regardless!

Now, onto the post itself. New chapter, new post summarizing it and theorizing with you guys!

First, let's see what happened and what we learned:

* The chapter starts with a shot of a bakery, and we see two employees with face masks on. We learn then that these are Count Saint-Germaine and the Exo-suit Kur lady (who is using an eyepatch to cover her fake eye).
* When the kur lady asks CSG why they are doing this, he insists that it is because he asked for her help. She thought it was to kill Okarun, but he says that killing Okarun is **her** objective, not his.
* She then mentions that the suit he gave her wasn't good, but he replies that she is just too weak and that she'll achieve nothing by pointing fingers at others for blame.
* When she insists that she isn't a baker, CSG tells her that outside working hours, she is free to do as she pleases, but since he hired her, she **is** a baker.
* Then, when smoke comes out of the oven, it is revealed that CSG didn't burn the bread, but it was Enenra who kneels to him, still beaten from the fight against Jiji and Evil Eye.
* CSG says that he doesn't like the smell of tobacco that Enenra brings to the kitchen, so they talk outside of it. Enenra reveals that the Serpos were the ones who sent the Chameleon alien to work with him, but that it got in the way of the mission.
* Enenra then shows a box with Kozuka knives inside it and tries to return it to CSG, saying that he takes responsibility for the failure and that he'll take it upon himself to retrieve the abilities he gave out to the other individuals.
* CSG says that Enenra didn't entirely fail, since they got useful information about yokai suitability and the development of the powers, using Kouki as an example of how she improved upon the Lord of the Flies' ability of her powers. He then mentions that having Enenra show himself puts the sorcerers' association on alert about their involvement.
* Enenra mentions that the Serpos asked for their help, but CSG replies that he does not trust them and that they most likely don't trust them either, since aliens can't use yokai powers, only humans.
* CSG mentions his new plan to Enenra: To befriend Okarun and their friends to create the ultimate Yokai. It is shown to us the user who had the Fairy Tale Card's powers connected to a chair in a shape that looks like the mandalas used when CSG mentioned the Dandadan for the first time.
* When the Kur lady is working alone, a little girl shows up and hands her a crane origami, which she accepts, showing us a more tender side to this character.
* Enenra leaves, not liking CSG's plan, since he believes that nobility befriending common people is preposterous.
* We cut back to Jiji and Seiko talking about Enenra and his title of Red Baron. Seiko starts to understand everything a bit better and explains that, in the past, a shaman friend of hers was grievously injured for what at first was thought to be a yokai but turned out to be a human from a group called ""The Black Paladins"".
* She then explains that those people collect powers from yokai and curses to then gain employment by companies as *diviners*, killing competition for them in the shadows. A famous one is known as ""The Flying Ace"" and shows us an image of Enenra.
* Now that they're operating in Japan, Seiko confirms that the sorcerers' association has put on various alerts, slowing any possible plan the black paladins may have.
* Seiko starts apologizing that she's the one who should be protecting them, but Jiji insists that she always does that, and he only beat Enenra thanks to her.
* Seiko is relieved that he's OK. Meanwhile, in the back, we see Vamola hugging Momo while Momo tries to get her off of her. It is worth pointing out that Vamola says, ""Momo, it's you!"", showing us that her memories of Momo came back when the curse was lifted.
* We end with Seiko mentioning to Jiji that what worries her now is that Momo not only forgot a lot of things, but that she also forgot how to use her powers.

And that's the chapter... Jeez, I wrote a lot. Guess it comes with the territory of lore-based chapters.

Now, let's theorize and discuss.

Firstly, we are finally starting to understand CSG a bit better. We don't know why he's doing all of that of the ultimate yokai, but we at least know what he wants to do.

We also learned that, indeed, the orchestrator was another person: Enenra... but under CSG's orders. So technically, one could say that CSG is the one who started this, but the way it was executed was all on Enenra and his decisions. I think CSG learned of Yokai improvement when he saw Okarun in action, but during the SG and Danmara. After all, Okarun improved a lot up to when CSG fought alongside him against FTC. So he started experimenting and wanted Enenra to put those people in perilous situations to see how they improved, leading to the discovery that yes, a perfect vessel will find ways to improve upon the yokai's powers. Now, what does he want to do with the ultimate yokai? Beats me. I don't think it's just a ""I want to be the only one with powers so I can get all the money from these companies"" or ""I want to be the sole protector of earth"". I guess we need more time to figure it out, but for now, we have his new objective. I linked this post by [Specialist\_Bowler897](https://www.reddit.com/user/Specialist_Bowler897/) on how the plan has been going on since the Kozuka knives arc started. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/comments/1nublid/orchestrator\_full\_timeline\_and\_scheme\_chp\_211/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/comments/1nublid/orchestrator_full_timeline_and_scheme_chp_211/)

The Kur Lady, having that moment, speaks volumes to her character. She's 100% having a change of heart at one point. How? It could be a cliché moment of almost killing Okarun, but Momo pleads for his life, making her think that if she kills Okarun, then she's no better than the Kur who took her beloved... Or it could be something else entirely.

Enenra. Well, clearly, he disagrees with CSG's new plan of befriending Okarun and co., so he'll most likely act on his own accord at one point. Maybe he's the biggest threat to the gang right now, since CSG's plan involves a friendlier approach now.

When CSG and Seiko mention that the sorcerers' association is aware of these and have put on various alerts, it's most likely Kashimoto and Payase's doing. After all, they were investigating these, so they most likely put out an APB or something.

Vamola mentioning Momo, like I said in the summary, completely shows that those who forgot about Momo can now remember who she is again. This means that Kinta most likely remembers her now or will remember her once he sees her (Which is most likely what happens, since it was mostly a thing of perceiving Momo, so once they lay eyes on her, the memories flood back).

Now, one thing I find odd here is the absence of Zuma, Daiki, and Raiya. We're shown that Vamola is awake now, which would mean others would wake up too. Multiple scenarios come to mind here. One, they're just waiting at the ryokan while Vamola went for Momo, Seiko, and Jiji at the hospital. Two, they are in the hospital's reception, since multiple people visiting a hospital room is not allowed. Or three, they are still in the shrine, which would lead to a theory I've seen for chapter 210 that this latest chapter doesn't prove or refute: This Momo is not the real Momo. The real Momo is cured and still at the shrine with Zuma and Daiki, and was never retrieved by Vamola to the ryokan because another Momo was found by her, an impostor. I won't go into details about it, since [TheAmplifier8](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAmplifier8/) did an amazing post detailing this theory and goes deep on aspects of Chapter 210 that were a bit off, especially regarding how Momo behaved. Granted, it is very unlikely, and we're just in a spiritual shenanigans situation regarding Momo losing her memories and not remembering how to use her powers, but it's fun that maybe two Momos are roaming around.

I've been hooked to Evil Eye (who hasn't?) ever since its introduction in the Cursed House Arc. 

I was mesmerised by the Ninja Castle Arc (?). Seiko getting pinned down by The Red Baron really hit hard and Jiji unleashing the Evil Eye to avenge his teacher was a beautiful addition. Jiji's immense control over his Chi and Evil Eye vs The Red Baron - one with sheer physicality and technique, the other clouding everything with illusion. 

Long way to go, but I'm really looking forward to the animation of Evil Eye / Jiji vs The Red Baron. I'm sure it would surpass the current best anime sequence, Evil Eye vs Okarun, of course.

The advantages and disadvantages of each job class, and possibly who's best to take which job class.

The promotion items are:

Silver Tank for Archers; Warrior Pride for Warriors; Vigor Ball for Priests; Pegasus Wing for Knights; Secret Book for Mages

Silver Tank can allow an Archer, either Elric or Janet to be promoted to Rhode's job class, Brass Gunner. Advantages, gets attack Stat up at least 1 to 2 points every level. Disadvantage, horrible movement and terrain movement. You're basically a Canon, and canons move slow in battle, but pack a punch. If you don't use Silver Tank, Archers become Snipers. Advantage, moves better in woods and aren't as effected by terrain. Disadvantage, hardly ever see attack Stat up. Basically, it's either good movement for sacrifice of attack if you go with Sniper, or sacrifice movement for attack. Really, both Elric and Janet play both roles evenly, though Janet might have a slight edge on attack. I'd give her the Silver Tank over Elric, but it's anyone's choice.

Warrior Pride makes a Warrior, like Jaha and Randolf, become a Baron. Advantages, can wield both swords and axes, gets slightly better movement, better attack increase. Disadvantages, doesn't get defense Stat as good as Warrior or Gladiator, and most swords are better than axes by 1 point which doesn't mean much mid game onward. If they don't use Warrior Pride, Warriors become Gladiators. Advantage, better defense Stat increases. Disadvantage, less movement than Baron. Truthfully, I don't think it matters much if Jaha or Randolf get the Warrior Pride. End game, they can be really good if you have magic items, like a sword to cast something as well as an axe if they're Baron, but really, if you prefer defense over offense, I suppose Gladiator is your go to. Randolf is technically a better Warrior than Jaha, but both could go either way as a Gladiator or Baron. I mostly prefer Jaha as a Baron so I can have Red Baron (Lemon) with Blue Baron, but that's just me.

Vigor Ball turns either Sarah or Karna into Master Monks. Advantage, Gloves can be equipped and have high attack power. Disadvantage, can't equip rods, staffs, or White Ring. Not using Vigor Ball makes Priests into Vicar. Advantages, more magic focused and more supportive with staffs, rods, and White Ring. Disadvantage, horrible attack. Karna is definitely good as a Master Monk as she doesn't benefit much with staffs, rods, or the White Ring because she already has Aura which White Ring casts, but mysterious staff could be useful for her if she was a Vicar, but really it's best to have her as a Master Monk. Sarah, while you can find another Vigor Ball and make both Karna and Sarah Master Monks, Sarah benefits better as a Vicar, mostly because the White Ring gives her the Aura spell, which she's the only healer without that spell naturally, plus the Wish rod can cast Attack spell, again, she doesn't have the spell naturally, and mysterious staff can help keep her MP recharging slowly to keep her casting magic. Sarah isn't bad as a Master Monk, but personally, she's way better as a Vicar.

Pegasus Wing can turn either Chester, Rick, or Eric into a Pegasus Knight. Advantage, can fly and maximize their movement. Disadvantage, no longer can take advantage of terrain defense. If you don't use Pegasus Wing, Knights become Paladins. Advantage, can use terrain defense...which isn't saying much as any non flyer can do so. Disadvantage, isn't flying and terrain impairments really effect Centaurs. Honestly, I find Rick to have more defense than Chester or Eric and I prefer him to have Pegasus Wing to become Pegasus Knight, mostly because they can't take advantage of terrain defense, so any defense helps in decreasing damage, otherwise, Eric is good as a Pegasus Knight. I would keep Chester as a Paladin. Really, it's down to either Rick or Eric as a Pegasus Knight, but either one of them is good.

Secret Book allows either Kazin or Tyrin to become Sorcerer. Advantage, cast summon magic which is great against a single enemy. Disadvantage, lose all spells to gain summon magic and its bad against multiple opponents. If Secret Book isn't used, Mages become Wizards. Advantage, capable of dealing with multiple enemies. Disadvantage, takes a while to fully Master spells and cost a bunch...not that summon magic fairs any better. Truthfully, Tyrin is better as a Sorcerer because his magic is very similar to Chad's magic, except 1 spell, but he learns his summon magic quicker than Kazin does and will have all summon magic at max level in a fair and reasonable level compared to Kazin who'll have to level up just a little more. But I will say,  I can understand people preferring Kazin as a Sorcerer vs Tyrin as Kazin mostly relies on Blaze spell, while Tyrin relies on Freeze, which is better, but Chad does as well. At a high enough level, Tyrin can get Bolt spell at level 4, but so does Chad, but Tyrin will get it faster. Kazin is also the only person who'll learn Desoul level 2, but that's debatable if you want to cast it or not, but can effect up to 5 people with better chance of instant death than level 1, but still, you'll mostly rely on Kazin's Blaze spell, and Chad and Tyrin both have Blaze as well. I prefer Tyrin as Sorcerer, but that's me.",,selftext,ShiningForce,TheGreatLuthe,32,32,0.97,2,False,False,True,False,,,Debate,self.ShiningForce,1757594781.0,2025-09-11T12:46:21+00:00

The chapter pretty clearly says that the Red Baron is a Yokai/Curse user using the knives through Seiko’s explanation. He probably is related to CSG, that’s why they look so similar. He does say he is nobility, like CSG, so the Baron part is probably literal, just like CSG is most likely the real Count of Saint Germain. That would also explain why he’s been active for so long, he probably is also an immortal being like CSG.

The first is how funny it is that Saint Germain opened a bakery called Tasty Gezeer Bread, reminding everyone that TG calls him ""Hyper Geezer,"" and he spends his time making BREAD and putting his highly dangerous henchmen to work as bakers. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Red Baron starts working there too in the upcoming chapters.

I have already presented researches about the Saturn-Neptune cycle, for example explaining how it can be related to the diffusion of Gnostic Ideas in modern culture as well as the development of Quantum Mechanics (if you are interested, it is available on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advancedastrology/comments/1gw8kvc/the_saturnneptune_cycle_gnostic_ideas_in_modern/) or on my [blog](https://astraclavis.substack.com/p/the-saturn-neptune-cycle-gnostic)).

As Saturn can be symbolically associated with what structures or limits, and Neptune with that which dissolves, it would make sense that the UFO phenomenon, which represents something from out of this world but also vague in nature, could be linked to it as well. UFO related events blur the frontier of what is commonly accepted as the concrete, basic, reality.

The following is the result of searching whether or not a correlation could be found between the Saturn-Neptune Cycle and the UFO Phenomenon.

As to provide a “stricter” investigation, only the years where the major aspects took place are taken into account. When a specific date for the event is available I have added the orb of the aspect. In some cases when the event is dated but the orb is too large I don’t specify it but as the event could be of interest I still kept it in the list. I consider this research as en entry point and admit that it could be expanded and further detailed.

Also, for readability purposes, the events listed are just a fraction of what could be found.

It is important to mention that it seems like other cycles could be involved. For example, the Uranus Synodic cycle in some instances or planetary conjunctions with the Nodes. I have yet to delve more precisely into those in order to be able to confirm it completely (or not).

I won’t enter into a debate regarding the reality of the phenomenon and its nature (or motives), but to simplify the subject we could say that there are four main hypothesis :

* UFOs are from Extraterrestrial origin.
* UFOs are Man made.
* UFOs are of Extradimensional origin (a lot of specificities could be added for that idea, of course).
* A mix of the three previous points. And when we say “mix” it does not only mean that the three possibilities can coexist at the same time but also that there are bridges, blends, influences, links, between the three, which highly complicates the understanding of what we are confronted with.

Would it be possible, using Astrology, to have a better idea of what type of case we are observing at a given moment ? Well, I started noticing certain patterns when the “experience” seemed more likely to involve some form of human participation but, once again, I still need to do more research to propose a solid hypothesis.

This post is divided into three sections : the first one presents “modern” and “well known” events related to the phenomenon, the second part presents some of “ancient” dated events as well as old artistic representations that could be linked to the UFO idea, and the last section is a short reflection on the matter and a possible forecast for the near future.

# Modern Era Events (1900-2026)

While the events listed may seem random for a lot of people who are not familiar with the UFO lore, a lot of these are major and usually recognized as “stepping stones” in the development of the phenomenon. Also, it is not a US-centered list.

1. **Saturn-Neptune conjunction of 1917**, exact on August 01st 1917 at 04°45 Leo :
   * ***Fatima Marian apparitions*** : While Catholics consider this case as Marian miracles, from my perspective and research, various elements seem to point towards a UFO-related phenomenon. I won’t enter into the debate about the exact nature of the events, but I suggest everyone curious to look into it, it is a fascinating case. To briefly resume : Over the course of 1917, three Portuguese shepherd children had visions/encounters with a being that ended up being associated with the Virgin Mary ; she would appear to them specifically on the 13th of each month between May and October 1917. What is said to be the Virgin, delivered a series of messages about World events to come as well as three secrets to the children and announced that she will perform a miracle on October 13th 1917. On that day, around 100 000 people gathered in Fatima and many saw what was designated as “The Miracle of the Sun” where, among other things, some people described seeing a spinning disc (that they would say was the Sun itself) emanating multicolored lights and making some form of dance in the Sky.
   * ***The Red Baron*** : The German pilot, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron was a fighter who became famous for shooting down 80 enemy planes for Germany during WWI. During the spring of 1917, while he was flying over Belgium he saw a “looking like an upside down silver saucer with orange lights” that he eventually shot down. Even weirder is that another witness, also a German Air Force ace that was present, reported to have seen two little baldheaded entities get out of the crashed machine and ran away.
2. **Saturn-Neptune conjunctions of 1952-1953**, exact on November 21st 1952 at 22°46 Libra, May 17th 1953 at 21°38 Libra and July 22nd 1953 at 21°12 Libra :
   * ***Washington Incident*** **\[\~5° orb\]** : In July 1952, Washington DC experienced an incredible amount of UFO sightings, most of them gathered around July 19th-20th and July 26th-27th. During this period only, the US Air Force received over 717 new reports, while the four precedent years had accumulated 615 UFO reports.
   * ***Project Blue Book*** : In 1952 was launched the Project Blue Book which was a systematic study of UFOs by the US Air Force that lasted until 1969. It collected 12618 UFO reports out of which 701 were classified as unexplained.
   * The Project Blue Book director, Edward J. Ruppelt mentioned : “During a six-month period in 1952, 148 of the nation’s leading newspapers carried a total of over 16 000 items about flying saucer.” All the 1952 year seem to have been a major peak period of UFO observations.
3. S**aturn-Neptune conjunctions of 1989**, exact on March 3rd 1989 at 11°54 Capricorn, June 24th 1989 at 11°14 Capricorn, and November 13th 1989 at 10°21 Capricorn :
   * ***Belgian Wave*** **\[\~1° orb\]** : In 1989 started what is known as the Belgian UFO Wave which lasted up until 1991. The day with the most known observations seem to be November 29th 1989, a bit after the last exact conjunction. Most of the observations mention a black triangle flying object with 4 spotlights. Some of these observations were directly done by the police, others were correlated with radar traces and various times F-16 planes were sent for interception.
   * ***Ucanca gathering*** **\[0° orb\]** : On the very same day the second conjunction of 1989 took place, June 24th, around 40 000 people gathered in Tenerife (Canary Islands) on the Ucanca Valley. The director and host of a program on the RNE (Spain national radio) decided to organized a direct there because he was convinced that a contact was going to take place. In the months prior, he started to received from different sources messages that a contact was about to happen. While no major event happened, the date chosen is stunning.

The incident was so significant that it prompted questions in the House of Commons. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, launched what could be considered the first government inquiry into UFO sighting. He stated :”I have caused inquiries to be made and have ascertained that an unknown aircraft was heard over Sheerness \[…\]. Flares were lighted at Eastchurch, but the aircraft did not make a landing. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate the nationality of the aircraft”.

On June 24th 1947, a few days before the sextile went exact, pilot Kenneth Arnold saw nine shiny disk-like objects flying at incredible speed near Mount Rainer, Washington. He described their movement as “like saucers skipping on water” which led the press to coin the term “flying saucers”.
   * ***Roswell Incident*** **\[<1° orb\]** : A few days after the sextile went exact, the US military recovered “an object” from a ranch near Roswell. The first announcement made by the US Army was that it was a “flying disc” but then retracted the next day by saying that it was a conventional weather balloon.

   * ***Dyatlov Pass Incident*** **\[\~3° orb\]** : While not exactly tied to the “classic“ UFO lore, there is nonetheless the presence of “bright flying spheres” in some reports. On February 2nd 1959 nine experienced hikers died mysteriously at the Dyatlov Pass, in the Ural Mountains of Russia. Overnight, something caused them to get out of their tent and flee the camp without proper equipment. Not all seem to have died in the same manner, some were killed by physical trauma, others from hypothermia, some bodies had missing eyes or tongue or even eyebrows. The conclusion of the investigation was “a compelling natural force” caused their deaths.

   * ***Varginha Incident*** **\[\~4° orb\]** : Known as the “Brazilian Roswell”, this case involves a lot of elements from the UFO lore and is hard to summarize in a few lines without missing fascinating pieces. On January 20th 1996, residents of Varginha, Brazil, reported seeing a UFO crash and to have close contact with alleged extraterrestrial beings (and even capturing them). Some reports indicate that the government recovered debris and beings as well. There also seem to have been unexplained animal deaths at the local zoo around the same time.

# Ancient Cases and Art Representations

Here is a very short list of past events and paintings that could be associated with the UFO phenomenon if considering a modern lens.

***Livy’s Chronicles (-173)***

There are multiple examples in Titus Livius historical records of strange sights in the sky. For 173 BC, he mention “at Lanuvium a spectacle of a great fleet was said to have been seen in the sky”.

In 173 BC, there were a Saturn-Neptune square (Cancer-Libra).

***Obsequens’ Chronicles (-154)***

Here is a comment from Julius Obsequens when reporting an event from 154 BC : “at Compsa weapons (*arma*) appeared flying in the sky”. Richard Stothers, from which this example and the previous one are taken in a compilation he made of Antiquity UFO-like events, states : “The term refers to defensive weapons, especially shields”.

In 154 BC, there were two Saturn-Neptune squares (Pisces-Sagittarius).

***Plutarch’s Testimony (-74)***

In 74 BCE, Plutarch of Chaeronea wrote about huge and alight objects in the sky during the battle between the armies of Lukulus and Mithridates VI, in Asia. He detailed that they were “wine vessel shaped” and silver color.

That year, -74, an opposition between Saturn and Neptune occurred (Sagittarius-Gemini).

***The Annunciation with Saint Emidius (1486) by Carlo Crivelli***

https://preview.redd.it/lfllyqybawqf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13e9a86aa4e071ed67d54dc5a44de34f4038d76

This painting is an artistic depiction of the Annunciation (the moment the archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary that, through a virgin birth, she will conceive and become the mother of the Messiah). On the forefront are represented Gabriel and Saint Emidius, the woman on the right is the Virgin Mary.

The ray of light coming from the circular cloud is supposed to mean the Holy Spirit.

Some modern commentators see in this “cloud” something akin to a UFO. While it may not have been the intention of the painter and while the painting does not represent an actual event witnessed, it is nonetheless curious to observe that this painting was done in 1486, the year of a Saturn-Neptune conjunction in Sagittarius.

***Basel Celestial Phenomenon (1566)***

This pamphlet page of 1566 describes numerous red and black balls in the sky before the Sun rising that seem to have “fought” against each other over the sky of Basel, Switzerland.

Between 1566 and 1567 there were three exact squares between Saturn and Neptune (Virgo-Gemini)

***Utsuro-bune, 虚舟 (1803)***

Utsuro-bune, literally “the hollow boat”, is the name given to an unknown object depicted in a Japanese legend, which is said to have happened in 1803 and was later published in 11 documents across the 19th Century. The story is about fishermen who saw a young woman with red hair abroad this “ship” which drifted ashore the eastern coast of Japan.

Here are some of the drawings made at that time :

This year, 1803, there was an exact sextile between Saturn and Neptune (Virgo-Scorpio).

# Reflections & Near Future

The next Saturn-Neptune conjunction will occur in 2026, exactly on February 20th.

Given the narrative that is currently unfolding and what has been presented in this post, it seems highly probable that (a) significant event(s) related to the UFO phenomenon will happen within the next months or in the next year.

While it could be a great news for all the UFO/ET enthusiasts as well as people in general, I would like to invite those who will be reading this to be cautious about it and to take what will be shown with a bit of distance. Indeed, it seems like a context is being purposely prepared and there might be some nefarious interest behind it. A complex mix of reality and lies to deceive the masses and to serve those who control (or wish to) them is a possibility.

The phenomenon has always shown some hybrid aspects and the idea or theory that we might have been manipulated in some form or another since millennia in that regard can’t be fully discarded.

Also, the Saturn-Neptune conjunction in Aries, will be receiving a sextile from both Pluto and Uranus which might be indicative of a Scientific paradigmatic shift and/or a seize of power through technological means or seize of technological power. This specific configuration will be explored in more detail (and for other contexts) in an upcoming post I have been working on.",,selftext,AstrologyResearch,Penitent17,5,5,1.0,0,False,False,True,False,,,,self.AstrologyResearch,1758624837.0,2025-09-23T10:53:57+00:00

Heimdall: And our fighters are off! Manfred's not letting up on the Dragon King!

Inside the cockpit of the plane, Manfred glared at his opponent, determined to finish it quick.

Manfred(POV): I gotta end this quick...

Manfred presses a few buttons on his control panel, and the plane's fuselage opened up, producing a miniature missile.

Manfred: Fire!

Manfred presses a big red button on his control panel, and the missile speeds out from the plane. The dragon king looks back, not even flinching at the missile.

Longwang: A ranged fighter? No matter.

Longwang pulled out his sword, a shining blue blade, and slices the missile in half.

Heimdall: W-Woah there folks! The Red Baron tried to finish the fight fast, but his opponent won't go down that easily!

Manfred: Scheiße!

Longwang: Now, if you're so adamant about finishing me off, I shall meet that attitude with equal enthusiasm!

Longwang commands his dragon forward, opening it's gaping maw to swallow Manfred, plane and all.

Manfred: Nein!

Manfred pulls up, and the plane narrowly dodges its doom.

Heimdall: ooh! A close call! This battle's taking us to cloud 9 already from the start! Wait...WOAH!

Heimdall quickly steers his own plane away from the gunfire of the Red Baron, the loyal dragon of Longwang tailing not too far behind.

Manfred(POV): Damn it! Come on Manfred, think! You've lead an entire squadron of pilots before, you can find a way to end this fast!

Aslaug: Manfred? Manfred come in!

Aslaug's voice came over a small comm, as Manfred detaches it from the control panel.

Manfred: Fraulein? What is it?

Aslaug: What's your status?! Are you alright?!

Manfred: I'm fine, but what of you?

Aslaug:...I'll manage, just please! Win!

Manfred bit his lip, knowing full well why Aslaug was saying she'll manage.

Manfred: Understood, just hold on!

Manfred hangs up, and pulls up fast.

Longwang: What?!

Heimdall: What is he doing?!

Manfred: I'm glad you asked Heimdall! Because I'm going to SHOW YOU!

Manfred begins to descend, flying over the mount of his opponent. Without hesitation, he opened fire.

Longwang: !?

Longwang quickly hopped off the eastern dragon, who's body was gunned down at lightning speeds.

Heimdall: WOAH! With a bold maneuver, Manfred von Richthofen takes down Longwang's dragon! That doesn't seem good!

Manfred: Now to finish this!

Manfred pulls down and squeezes the trigger, going in again to kill Longwang.

Longwang: Straight to the point again, I can respect a man like that. However...

Longwang pulls out a jade green stone from his robes, the design was that of a bipedal dragon, it's wings connected to it's 2 arms.

Longwang: Heed my call, oh beast of venom! Let thine claws pierce through my foes and your fangs deliver their poison!

A magic circle appears in front of Longwang, as another dragon flew out from it. This time, a wyvern with purple scales, and large wings.

**Dracomancy: Wyvern**

Heimdall: Wow! Another Dragon! Looks like he came prepared!

Manfred's eyes widen as he spins the plane to the other side, narrowing avoiding a quick death. The Wyvern flew back down and safely rescues Longwang on it's back.

Manfred: You got more?!

Longwang: Indeed, if you desire to surrender, I'll be as generous as to accept it!

Manfred: Sorry...but I cannot do that. Mission comes first.

Manfred flies back in, determined to take out this 2nd dragon.

Longwang: Careful, it's as they say: Every rose...

The dragon swings it's tail towards the plane, Manfred manages to escape with only a scratch on the paint job on the left wing.

Longwang: Has it's thorns.

However, despite managing to escape, the dragon's tail seemed to have a deadly surprise...it's coated with venom. The scratch begins to melt the wing of the plane, as the Red Baron begins to dive.

Heimdall: And the Red Baron takes a fall! Could this spell Humanity's 3rd loss in a row?!

**V.I.P Stands: Valkyries**

Aslaug's eyes widen, as Michael and Lev stood up.

Aslaug: NO!

Michael: Don't worry Miss Aslaug! I'm sure Mr. Manfred's gonna be A-ok!

Lev: Yes...he's not going down that easily...right?

**In the arena...**

Manfred(POV): Scheiße...I need to perform an emergency maintenance!

Manfred presses a few things on his touchscreen, as a new wing forms in the back.

Manfred: Alright...this should do!

Manfred presses a button on both his boots, and opens the canopy.

Longwang: Quick! Don't let him repair his vehicle!

The Wyvern dives down, it's tail preparing to pierce through the German pilot. Manfred gets on the wing of his plane, the replacement in hand.

Heimdall: My goodness! The Red Baron's making a risky move here! One wrong move, and he's gonna become Dragon food!

Manfred: Almost...

Manfred stomped on the wing, as it flew off. Manfred attaches the replacement on, as noises could be heard from inside.

Manfred: New wing connected, alles klar!

Manfred hears the roar of the dragon, and realizes that it was closing in on him.

Manfred: Uh oh...

Manfred quickly hops back into his canopy, closes it, and pulls up. The dragon narrowly misses falling into the water.

Longwang: Not bad...

Longwang steers the dragon after the Red Baron, continuing the dog fight.

**V.I.P Stand: Valkyries.**

Aslaug looked nervous, as she grew sicker and sicker as the seconds passed.

Michael: Aslaug, are you ok? You don't look too good...

Aslaug: I'll be fine...I'm just-

Suddenly, an explosion goes off from another missile made by Manfred. Aslaug falls down and begins recoiling.

Lev: Young Lady!?

Michael: ASLAUG!

Michael and Lev rush over to check on her.

Michael: Aslaug what's wrong?! Are you ok?!

Aslaug: I'll be fine! I need to be! So Manfred can win!...

Michael: What?! What does Manny winning have to do with...

Michael quickly realizes why Aslaug was growing weak.

Michael: Aslaug...what was Manfred's völundr?

Aslaug:...

Michael: Aslaug please, I need to know.

Lev: A-Are you insinuiating that the two of them...

Aslaug shook her head.

Aslaug: We didn't, his weapon came from Anesidora...

Michael: That doesn't answer my question, WHAT was his Volundr? Is it his plane? Was it so large that it drained out YOUR energy too!? How can Anesidora produce a plane of all-

Aslaug: His Volundr isn't the plane!

Lev: Then...what is it?

Aslaug:...

World war 1, a deadly time to be alive. But despite it all, people were willing to serve, but some...**were looking for something more thrilling.**

A young cavalry officer storms into the tent of a general, and slammed his hand down on the table. This officer had blond hair and blue eyes, with his uniform indicating he was of the Prussian army.

**Manfred von Richthofen(German, the man who would become the ""Red Baron"")**

Manfred: This is an outrage! Why is it that I cannot see battle!? I joined a war and you refuse to let me fight!?

The general sighed.

General: Oberst Richthofen, for the last time: There's nothing we can do! The style of war has changed, and Cavalry are no longer needed!

Manfred: Then what is needed?! I want to fight! I don't care how I must! I will fight for my country!

General: Well, how do you plan to?

Manfred: I...

Manfred quickly thinks, how can he fight for his country with cavalry now left behind as a style of war?

Manfred: I...I'll think of something and report back! But mark my words! You will see me in action!

Manfred stormed out of the tent, determined to find a way to see combat.

Manfred(POV): Ahhh, think! How can I fight?! I don't really want to fight on the ground, it's too slow! Maybe I can look to join the fighters out at sea? No...it's too confined for my tastes! Come on Manfred! Think!

Suddenly, he hears a whoosh from above. He looks up to see planes flying overhead. Each one of them was piloted by a soldier. And suddenly, right then and there: Manfred gained a flash of inspiration.

Manfred: THAT'S IT!

Manfred runs back into the tent.

Manfred: I know what I want to transfer to!

**And with that, Manfred's journey as a fighter in the air began.**

Manfred, seated behind in a plane, was scouting the skies. He was tasked with being the observer of a plane.

Manfred(POV): Dang it...I thought I was signing up to fight! Why am I stuck acting as a spotter?!

Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he spots a moving target.

Manfred: LOOK OUT!

Manfred took out a pistol, a Luger to be exact, and shot down the enemy pilot. 

Pilot: WHAT THE?! You're supposed to be an observer! Not shoot down enemies! What if your bullet hit me?!

Manfred scoffed.

Manfred: You're welcome for that save! Dummkopf! 

**But then...came the first solo flight.**

Manfred sat down in a tent, bandaged up. In front of him sat a tall muscular man in a general's outfit.

**Georg Zeumer(German, Observer for Prussian Air force)**

Georg: Are you kidding me?! The moment we let you go solo, you crash the plane!?

Manfred: I'm sorry ok?! I got excited since it was my first flight solo and all and just...you know...

Georg: No, I don't! You just showed me you still need to fly with supervisors still!

Manfred groaned, annoyed that he had his solo flying privileges taken, but determined to get them back.

**But, with sheer dedication, he finally earned his wings.**

Manfred looked at the badge, proud.

Manfred: Yes...finally! I did it!

???: Congrats there, you did great!

A tall man in a general's uniform walked to greet him.

**Oswald Boelecke(German, Ace in the German Air Force)**

Manfred: Herr Boelecke! I can't take all the credit, you were the one to put me on the path!

Oswald smiled

Oswald: Well, I'll take some of that credit then!

Both men enjoyed a good laugh for a moment, distracting themselves from the war they were fighting.

Oswald: But that's not why I'm here Manfred, I'm here to ask you...to join a fighter squadron I'm putting together.

Manfred's eyes widen, this was the chance he's been waiting for this whole time.

Manfred:...when do we start?

**From that day on, Manfred became a member of Jasta 2. Improving his skills under the watchful eye of Oswald. Soon, he was given the chance to become part of something much bigger...**

Manfred enters a poorly lit room, as a general sat in a chair.

Manfred: You wanted to see me sir?

General: Yes, I've seen how you are Manfred...and I want to propose to you something.

Manfred: I'm flattered, but you're not my type.

The General facepalmed.

General: Not like that, I mean I have an offer for you. The higher ups have decided to fuse some of the Jastas together to form larger wings...and we want *you* to lead the first one.

Manfred: Me?

General: Yes, you've made quite the reputation for yourself. Plenty of kills under your belt, tutoring from some of the best pilots in German history...there's no other candidate better than you. So what do you say?

The general extended out his hand, as Manfred...took it.

Manfred: I accept, anything for my country!

**And so, Manfred lead the Jagdgeschwader** **I in World War I. He gained more and more kills, not stopping until...**

The Red Baron was chasing after a sopwithe camel, flying after it despite being wide open. But...**it was all a ploy made by the Red Baron.**

**Earlier...**

An Australian general had just recieved a call, and goes to pick it up.

General: Hello?

Manfred: Guttentag, this is Rittmeister Manfred von Richthofen.

General: What!? A german!?

Manfred: Calm down, I am not here to threaten you or anyone else.

General: Then why are you calling?!

Manfred: I...I have a favor to ask.

General:...explain.

Manfred: War has taken it's toll on me, and I can no longer continue going on...I'm asking you, as a fellow soldier...**to kill me**.

The general's eyes widen, what was this guy saying?!

General: Y-You're crazy! You **want** to die?!

Manfred: Why is it you're acting as if you're against it? I am your enemy no?

General: Y-Yeah, but this is insane! You're throwing a curveball at me here!

Manfred: I know...but please, I know none of my fellow Germans would do it...but I know you could...

The general hesitated for a moment, but sighed.

General: I'll arrange something for you sir...

Manfred, on the other line, smiled.

Manfred: Danke.

And thus, both hung up.

**That flight was the last flight of Manfred's life. Getting shot from below, he crashed his plane into a field. With a single ""Kaput"", the Red Baron was put to rest.**

**Valhalla, a bit before Ragnarok.**

The hanger opens, and Göll walks into it. There, she sees Manfred von Richthofen cleaning a few of his planes.

Göll: Excuse me good sir.

Manfred stops and turns to Göll.

Manfred: May I help you?

Göll: You can, actually. Are you Manfred von Richthofen?

Manfred: And if I am?

Göll: Then I'm at the right place. I need your help sir. Ragnarok II has been commenced, and I need to assemble a team of fighters to determine Humanity's survival.

Manfred: I see...but I'm not someone you should look to, there are those with more kills than I, and those who are better pilots than I. Try them, not me.

Manfred goes back to cleaning his plane.

Göll: Give me some examples if you'd be so kind.

Manfred sighed, annoyed a bit.

Manfred: Erich Hartmann, Amelia Earhart, Yevdokiya Bershanskaya, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Charlie Brown, Franz Stigler, and many others. Now please, leave me.

Göll: I could...but when I asked them, they all said **you** were the best to Represent Humanity.

Manfred: I am not, I don't know where they had that idea from, but I'm not the best choice.

Göll:...Then you're gonna let your country be destroyed?

Manfred stops mid wipe, and turns back.

Manfred: What?

Göll: If you don't help me, there's a good chance Humanity will be exterminated. That includes Germany, your fatherland, no?

Manfred:...Hurensohn.

Manfred walks up to Göll.

Manfred: Consider me in, no matter what...**I will always protect my country.**

Aslaug: Dang it...

Aslaug was growing weaker by the second, it was clear she didn't have much in the tank left.

Michael: Dang it...we need him to hurry up!

Suddenly, the radio in Aslaug's hand begins buzzing.

Manfred: Fraulein!? Are you there?!

Aslaug: Manfred! What is wrong?!

Manfred: Nothing at the moment, but I have a bad feeling. Longwang's ability...he can summon multiple dragons at one time, and we have no idea how many he can have with him during that period. I'm asking you, Fraulein...permission to call **them?**

Lev: Back up!? I thought that's not allowed!?

Aslaug:...

Michael: Wait...back up!? But how will they harm a god?!...

Michael has a sudden realization.

Michael: No...

Michael grabbed the radio from Aslaug.

Michael: Manfred you didn't!

Manfred: Herr Jackson?

Michael: Manfred tell me you didn't do what I think you did!

Manfred:...you figured it out huh?

Michael: NO! I forbid it!

Lev: Wait what is happening?!

Michael: his plan...he can't defeat Longwang on his own...

Lev: Wait...but then why even have him fight?

Michael: Because his strength isn't in his ability to kill...**it's his ability to lead...**

Aslaug: Don't be mad at Manfred!

Michael: But-

Aslaug: I gave him permission to do it! I said it before, I'll win no matter what! Even if I have to die!

Aslaug grabbed the radio.

Aslaug: Manfred...I authorize you to mobilize **them**...but make it count!

Manfred, piloting his plane from the canopy, bit his lip.

Manfred: Understood, I apologize in advance Fraulein.

Aslaug: Apologize after you get us that win...

Aslaug hangs up, as Manfred punches in another number on his dashboard.

Manfred: Erich? **Tell everyone to make the preparations.**

In the dogfight, Longwang summons smaller whelps, as they charge forward and attack the plane from all directions.

Heimdall: Woah! Manfred's plane is getting an Omnidirectional beating! Things look dire for the Red Baron folks!

Longwang: Hmph, die already.

Longwang summons another Xulong and hops on it. Ordering the mighty beast to charge forward and ram into the damaged plane.

Manfred: Gh!

Longwang: Your time is up, Red Baron! Now...FALL!

Longwang stabs the canopy with his sword, as Manfred is grazed at the cheek.

Heimdall: Is Manfred finished?! How will he get out of the maw of the Dragon King?!

Manfred: Well...if there's no way out on any side...then the only way out is up!

Manfred ejects the key from his plane, grabs it, and pulls a lever that ejects his seat out of the damaged vehicle.

Heimdall: And what an escape attempt! Will the Dragon King give chase?!

Longwang: Will I give chase? What question is that? Strike him down!

The Dragon flies toward Manfred, determined to eat him whole. But...he hops out of his seat at the last second?!

Longwang: What!?

The seat hits the dragon square in the face, distracting it long enough...for gunshots from a technologically upgraded Messerschmitt Bf 109 to hit it in the face. Causing the dragon to dissipate into green dust.

Longwang: WHAT?!

Manfred lands on the plane's wing, and looks into the canopy.

Manfred: Nice timing Erich!

Erich, the pilot of the plane, gives Manfred a thumbs up. Soon, he regroups with multiple other planes of various shapes and sizes. All of them piloted by experienced pilots throughout human history.

Manfred: It seems everyone's accounted for...

Manfred cleared his throat.

Manfred: Like what you see Longwang?! This is the fruit of aviation advancement! Alone, they may not be very frightening...but together?! We shall be the sun that clips your wings! Grab a final meal...because **THE FLYING CIRCUS IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!**

\-one was a greyish moutain area with a golden gate-like bridge

\-the other was more red ish desert area with moutains like in the australian outback.

the cars i cant really remember i think they looked similar to old nascar cars but unsure,i know the game allowed you to fully destroy the car by driving into the mountains or off.

graphics looked pretty old pre 2000s ish going from my memory.

the only other thing i for sure remember is that you could use a low poly red baron-like plane to fly around the map that you could also had a destructable model.

mightve been a tech demo,but i really cant remember its been over 20 years now but it eludes me to this day.",,selftext,tipofmyjoystick,KH-Freack,3,3,1.0,6,False,False,True,False,,,,self.tipofmyjoystick,1758616475.0,2025-09-23T08:34:35+00:00

Manfred(POV): This is so weird! I can't sense any form of killing intent in his attacks! Why!?...

Longwang: You're wide open pilot!

Manfred: What?!

Manfred's radar suddenly begins beeping wildly. Confused, he soon realizes another projectile was heading for him!

Manfred: What?!

Manfred quickly dives out of the way, he turns to see the source of the projectile and realizes...it was another dragon?! This time, it had multiple heads, and was in the water.

**Dracomancy: Hydra.**

Heimdall: What!? Another Dragon!? It seems The Dragon King is playing more cards!

Manfred: What the-another Dragon!? When!? I didn't see you use a spell or hold an amulet!

Longwang: Only beginners use spells like that! My bond with my dragons is simply strong enough that I no longer require amulets to summon them!

Manfred: Hurensohn!

Manfred(POV): Ok...he can summon more than 1 dragon...but that must mean his energy is getting drained quicker! I just need to wait it out and I'll be good! Wait no...that could take long...Think, how could I...I got it!

Manfred flies toward the Hydra, his sights locked on.

Longwang: Fly after him! We can pincer and end this fast!

The Wyvern flies after the plane, as the Hydra opened fire at Manfred.

Heimdall: is The Red Baron crazy!? He's flying straight for the Hydra!

**Audience Stands**

In the stands, Erich laughs at Heimdall's comment.

Erich: Ha ha ha! Silly little god! Der Rote Kampfflieger always has a plan! He's not gonna go down to the likes of a few lizards!

Amelia: Yeah! Go get them!

Fellow pilots cheered on Manfred, praying for his victory.

**In the arena...**

Manfred(POV): Yes...pincer me...come on!...

Manfred weaves and dodges as the Hydra closes in with all its heads biting at the plane. Meanwhile, the Wyvern raises it's tail to strike the German ace.

Longwang: Strike him down!

Manfred(POV): NOW!

Manfred pulls up at the last second, getting out of danger. Longwang realized what his opponent's plan was, but it was too late. He couldn't escape as the Wyvern's tail had penetrated one of the Hydra heads.

Manfred: Gute Nacht, Drachenkönig!

Manfred presses a few buttons, as a bomb forms underneath the plane's fuselage. Upon the pull of a lever, the bomb drops down on Longwang and his dragons.

Longwang: You clever bastard...

The bomb detonates upon impact, causing the dragons to revert back to where they came.

Heimdall: WOAH! And with a quick pull, The Red Baron takes out three birds with one stone!

Longwang: I wouldn't say three stones Heimdall!

Longwang appears out of the sea, now with a dragon with a serpentine body. The creature's body was seaweed green in color, and had a large horn protruding out from it's head.

**Dracomancy: Leviathan**

Heimdall: He survived that?!

Manfred: Damn it...die already!

Manfred flies back in, opening fire. Longwang slices the bullets with his sword, not even a scratch landing on him.

**V.I.P Balcony: Valkyries.**

Aslaug: AUGH!

Michael: Aslaug!

Michael checks on the young Valkyrie.

Aslaug: Sorry...it just really hurts when he shoots or creates any sort of explosive...I'll manage though! Promise!

Aslaug gets back up.

Lev: But...isn't he the greatest pilot in human history? why is he struggling.

Aslaug: Because-gh!....he's not the greatest pilot in human history...

It seems that for Round 10, it will take place outside the usual arena. As we cut to a large dome. The dome itself had a clear blue sea situated on the bottom, on top of it a few land pieces. On both sides of the arena, metal hangars sat. One decorated with beautiful jade stones, the other with flags of all kinds. The similarity that bound them all was that all of them, at some point in history, were used to represent the country of Germany. Heimdall sat on a small plane, wearing a bomber jacket and aviator cap.

Heimdall: And we're back with Round 10 of Ragnarok II! Last time, the gods managed to get a lead! But can humanity make a comeback? Who knows! Now...enter! The god's fighter!

The hangar on the left opened, and out came a large dragon. On it was a man with a long gray beard, and he wore a long hanfu covered in scales of many colors. His eyes a deep blue, just like the sea he flew over.

Heimdall: Wyverns! Drakes! Even the mighty Hydras! They all bow down to this man! Hailing from the chinese pantheon, he was once a tyrant, ruling with an iron fist! Yet...he soon changed! And the fist he ruled with eased up! But did his strength ease up with it? We'll just have to see! Welcome in the Lord of Dragons! LONGWANG!

The dragon stopped in the center of the arena, as Longwang patted it on the head.

**Longwang(Chinese, God's representative for Round 10)**

Longwang: Good lad.

Heimdall cleared his throat.

Heimdall: And now! Enter! Humanity's fighter!

The hangar on the right opened, and the spinning of a propeller could be heard. Soon, a fighter aircraft flew out of it. The plane was red in color, with inverted gull wings. Wheels were retracted under the fuselage, and 2 machine guns were mounted beside them under the wings. In the cockpit, Manfred was seated in the cockpit, protected by a canopy.

Heimdall: World War 1! A time where the whole world was close to falling apart! Yet, in the wake of destruction and death, it birthed many new ways of combat! But one stood out amongst the rest...that's right! It's the way of Aerial warfare! Armed with a plane and a sharp aim, this man took to the skies and fought for his country with all he had! He went by many names...but you know him best by maybe these ones! GERMANY'S ACE OF ACES! THE RINGLEADER OF THE FLYING CIRCUS! THE RED BARON! MAAAAAANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN!

Manfred stopped at the center, small jets letting the plane hover in place. The canopy opens, and out stepped Manfred.

Manfred: Danke for the introduction.

Heimdall: No problem! Nice plane by the way!

Manfred: Thank you, now you're the one I'm fighting?

Manfred focused on Longwang, who's gaze was sharp.

Longwang: It is, and please explain to me what that...contraption, is?

Manfred: My plane? Well, it's how I'll fight...but you just need to know it as the thing that'll help me end your life.

Longwang smirked.

Longwang: Well then, Mr. ""Red Baron"", which is ironic since you're barely wearing any red, give me your best shot.

Manfred walked back to his cockpit, and closed the canopy.

Manfred: Whenever you're ready Heimdall.

Heimdall nodded, and raised his Gjallarhorn.

Heimdall: Fighting for the gods, the Dragon King, Longwang! Fighting for Humanity, the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen! Let Ragnarok II...COMMENCE!

No sooner as Heimdall said ""Commence"", Manfred squeezed the trigger, as the machine guns began shooting out volleys of bullets. Longwang commanded his dragon to rise up, and takes to the air.

Manfred: I won't let you escape that easily!

Manfred flies after Longwang, his trigger finger not resting.

**V.I.P area: Valkyries**

Aslaug, now chaperoned by Michael and Lev, watched the fight, tense.

Aslaug(POV): Win Manfred...please...and make it fast...

As Aslaug watched the fight, she looked to be growing a bit weak.

**Flashback**

Aslaug walked behind Manfred, as the two made their way to his waiting room.

Aslaug: So what is it you need to get for your match, Mr. Richthofen?

Manfred: Please, call me Manfred Fraulein. And What we're getting, is just a couple supplies.

The two make it to the door, a large steel hangar entrance with a giant propeller in the middle of it.

Manfred: Hold on.

Manfred grabs ahold of the Propeller, and spins it. As the propeller spins, the door opens. Inside, planes of different shapes and sizes sat. Alongside many humans working on them.

Aslaug: Woah...

Manfred: Watch your step.

Manfred walked into the area, greeting his fellow pilots.

???: Herr Richthofen! Good to see you sir!

A man who was slightly shorter than Manfred came up to them, he wore a dark blue camo vest, a piloting helmet with goggles, some simple brown gloves missing the fingers for the index and middle fingers, camo-jeans and a bit of a smirk on his handsome young face.

**Erich Hartmann(German, The Black Devil)**

Manfred: Erich, good to see you as well.

Erich looks over Manfred's shoulder, and sees Aslaug. His smirk becomes a wide grin as he zips over in front of the young Valkyrie.

Erich: Ah ah ah! You must be the young Walküre Aslaug! It is an honor to meet you! Oberst Erich Hartmann! At your service Ma'am!

Erich did a stiff salute, as Aslaug is taken aback.

Aslaug: Y-you know of me?

???: Know of you? Kiddo, you're practically a star here!

The voice came from behind, as a young woman with curly brown short hair, and green eyes. She wore a brown bomber jacket with blue jeans and hi-top sneakers.

**Amelia Earhart(American, Activist and trailblazer)**

Amelia: So THIS is the little girl that's leading the charge for Humanity I've heard so much about! You are just so adorable I could eat you up! C'mere!

Amelia grabbed Aslaug and pulled her into a hug.

???: Amelia, don't hug people you just met now.

Another woman, wearing heels and a general outfit, came from behind Amelia. She spoke with a heavy Russian accent.

**Yevdokiya Bershanskaya(Russian, Commander of the ""Night Witches"")**

Amelia: Oh come on! she's fine with it, right kiddo?

Aslaug: uh...

Manfred cleared his throat.

Manfred: If you're all done coddling her, we need to go and prepare for Round 10.

Erich: You're fighting Herr Richthofen?!

Manfred: I am, now come Fraulein, I need to get something.

Aslaug is released from Amelia's grip as she follows Manfred. Soon, they stopped at a closed area.

Manfred: Behold...

Manfred pressed a button, as the doors open to reveal every plane used by the great German fighter ace.

Aslaug: Woah...

Manfred: Now...

Manfred walks over to one that was covered by a sheet.

Manfred:...let's go with you.

Manfred takes off the sheet to reveal a triplane, painted red.

Aslaug: This is...

Manfred: my Fokker Dr.I, yes.

Aslaug: But this is the plane you're gonna use? Why not use your Albatros D.III or D.V? Those were the planes you got your most kills in, no?

Manfred chuckled.

Manfred: You did your homework, good girl. Yes, they were the planes I got most of my victories in...but this one...was the one I died in. And I can hear it.

Aslaug: Hear it?

Manfred nodded.

Manfred: It wants justice...it wants to correct the wrong it faced many years ago.

Aslaug shrugged.

Aslaug: Alright...just reach your hand into Anesidora and we'll be on our way!

Manfred nodded, and did so. taking his hand out, his volundr gave off a bright light.

Aslaug: W-Woah! Your Volundr is...

# *Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures'*  
**""It's A Wonderful Misadventure""**     
**A Christmas Special**  

Snow pressed down hard on Philadelphia that Christmas Eve. The gutters froze, the trolley bells sounded thin and lonely, and Mouse Capone trudged through Market Street with his hat pulled low.

The newsstand by 12th Street carried the day’s gossip rag. Mouse almost walked past until a headline snagged his eye:

**“CAIRO MUSEUM DIRECTOR WELCOMES TWELFTH CHILD.”**

A photo: Isabella in her furs, standing on the steps of a grand estate. Boxer beside her and children clutching at her skirt. She was radiant. Secure. Safe.

Mouse felt something cold squeeze his chest. He crumpled the paper and tossed it into the slush.

---

At the club later, things only soured. **Blue Puppy** burst in out of breath, ears drooping. “Boss… I lost the shipment. Monkey Tycoon’s boys cut us off. They—they took everything.”

The room went silent. Rudy cursed under her breath. Faraday’s tail lashed sparks off the floor.

Mouse rubbed his eyes. He could already feel the Syndicate’s squeeze. And sure enough, an hour later, a slick envelope slid under the club’s front door. Inside: a card embossed with Synclair’s smirk, and the words:

**“TIME’S UP, CAPONE. HAND OVER YOUR ROUTES OR YOUR CREW PAYS.”**

Mouse’s stomach turned. He looked at Blue Puppy — trembling, trying not to cry — then at Minx, whose eyes were dark with worry.

He squared his shoulders. “Nobody touches my crew. Not Monkey. Not anyone. I’ll take the heat.”

But when he stepped outside into the cold, the doubt gnawed at him.
Was it worth it? Sticking his neck out like this, keeping this crew afloat, when the city seemed determined to grind them down?

In the rush of the river of the avenue bridge, Mouse muttered, “Maybe the world’d be better off if I was never in it.”

And that’s when the snow flared, and a figure tumbled from the sky into the river — the **Red Baron Caterpillar**, airplane wings bent, goggles steaming. He cursed in German, then dusted himself off.

“Capone? You picked a hell of a night to despair. Lucky for you, I’m your guardian. Real name’s Clarence. Well—Baron Clarence. I earn my wings tonight by fixing sorry cases like yours.”

---  

Snow and neon melted into a grey hush. Market Street was gone. Mouse stood on a hill above a city that looked familiar but wrong — blocky high-rises, no jazz pouring from basement doors, no little crews weaving through alleys.

The Caterpillar flicked open his ledger. “Philadelphia, without Mouse Capone.”

They walked.

First stop was the corner where Mouse’s club used to be. In its place stood a chrome-and-glass “family supper club,” garland in the windows, piped carols on a loop. Patrons ate quietly at identical booths.

“Where’s Minx?” Mouse asked.

Inside, on a small stage, Minx stood in a sequined gown, fronting a clean corporate frog jazz trio. Her tail was still, her playing precise. She smiled at the crowd — a real smile — and when she saw a child at the front, she bent to hand him a candy cane.

“She’s doing better,” Mouse whispered. “She got out.”

“Some do,” the Caterpillar said. “Without you, Minx took a scholarship, played the clubs straight, made it to the nice side of town. She doesn’t even know your name.”

Mouse felt a stab of pride and pain mixed. “Good for her,” he muttered.

They walked on. A winter wind blew, carrying the smell of cheap coffee and bad decisions. The Caterpillar stopped at a chain-link fence around a city shelter.

Inside, a young **Blue Puppy** huddled on a cot, thinner than Mouse had ever seen him, fur patchy. He wasn’t bouncing off the walls. He wasn’t even looking up.

“He never got adopted,” the Caterpillar said softly. “No Mouse to pull him out of the pound, no crew to teach him the ropes. The city chewed him up and spat him out.”

Mouse pressed his paw to the fence. “Kid…”

Blue Puppy didn’t look up. A volunteer handed him a bowl of food. He ate slowly, eyes on the floor.

The Caterpillar snapped his ledger shut and they moved on.

Last stop was an abandoned rail yard. Snow drifted through broken windows. In the corner a hunched figure scribbled on the walls with chalk, feathers in disarray.

“Featherstone,” Mouse breathed.

Professor Featherstone was muttering equations and riddles to himself, eyes wild, no students to quote poetry at, no lab to tinker in. Without Mouse’s racket to fund his eccentricities, he’d fallen into madness.

Mouse took a step toward him but the Caterpillar held him back. “He can’t see you. This isn’t your world.”  

---  

The Baron’s shadow spread like a great clockface over the frozen Atlantic as they drifted again. “Another stop,” it said, “the ones you called your anchors.”

Mouse blinked at a snowy quay that hadn’t existed for a hundred years. Stone arches, iron lamps, gulls screaming over half-sunk barges. And there, unloading crates under the moonlight, were two hulking silhouettes: Ivan and Boris, the twin bears. Their fur was shaggy, their shoulders bent. No matching jackets, no new-world swagger — just patched work coats and old world scarves.

They heaved barrels of brine and saltfish down a gangplank in silence. No coded jokes, no card games on the dock, no conspiratorial nods. They were muscle for hire, still, but muscle chained to a port that had forgotten them. A harbormaster tossed them coins as if to dogs.

Mouse pressed his nose to the frost on the window of air. “They never crossed?”

“They never had anyone to take the chance with,” said the Baron. “Without you they stayed here, shuffling cargo for petty smuggling rings, never seeing the cities you showed them, never learning to laugh like outlaws.”

Boris wiped his paws on a rag. Ivan lit a cigarette, staring out across the black water. On the far horizon a liner’s lights glimmered like a string of pearls — a ship bound west. Neither of them moved.

Mouse’s whiskers drooped. “They look like ghosts.”

“They are ghosts of a choice,” the Baron murmured. “All your lives bent around one another. Pull out a single strand and everything frays.”

The bears turned back to their work, and the snow swallowed their shapes. The quay dissolved into ash. Mouse was left with the sound of gulls fading into nothing.

---  

The frost-smudged quay fell away and the Baron’s wingtip traced another circle in the dark.
“Two more,” he said softly. “The ones who sharpened each other.”

Mouse blinked again and found himself looking down at a dim rehearsal hall lit by a single flickering bulb. There was Puck the Platypus—no quicksilver glint in his eyes, no portfolio under his arm, no half-mad schemes spilling from his bill. He sat slouched on a folding chair, staring at a script he’d never finish. Around him the room smelled of stale coffee and mothballs.

Across the stage, White Leopard, once a white-hot teacher and actor whose claws left marks in your soul—sat behind a desk, drowsy. No critiques, no biting lines, no feral elegance. His scarf was askew. His gaze drifted out the cracked window. Without Puck pushing him, challenging him, mocking him, he’d slid into comfort; a teacher taking attendance, a cat with no hunt left.

Mouse watched as Puck shuffled up to hand in a half-scribbled page. White Leopard nodded absently and stamped it. No clash, no fire. Just two predators declawed by inertia.

“They look tired,” Mouse murmured.

“They are,” the Baron said. “You were the stone in their shoe. Without you, Puck never learned to dream bigger, and White Leopard never had to defend his throne. Together they settled into a slow forgetting.”

Mouse pressed his paw to the invisible glass. The smell of sawdust and paper rose like a ghost. In some far-off corridor he could almost hear their old bickering, the dueling monologues, the applause of a class warfare electrified. Here there was only silence.

The Baron’s wing cut a slow arc. “Shall we?” he said.

The stage dimmed, the chairs folded themselves into shadow, and the two shapes—platypus and leopard—slumped into stillness as the tour moved on.

---  

The Baron banked low over a rain-slick street lined with dim cafés and shuttered shops. A single blue police lamp glowed at the far end, throwing out a cone of pale light. Inside it stood a hulking grey figure, trench coat collar up against the drizzle.

Inspector Henri Elephant still looked like a mountain with a badge, but there was something smaller about him now. Without Mouse’s capers to pull him off the rails, his life had become a string of routine chases—contraband smugglers, counterfeit honey rings, a few middling jewel thefts. He’d chased one big name years back and never quite caught it. His tusks had dulled; his case files sat in piles on his desk, the edges curling. He was still a detective, still an elephant, but the scent of mystery had gone thin.

Up the steps of Animal Interpol Headquarters, another light burned. A slender bird in a perfectly pressed uniform signed papers with a quick, precise stroke. Constable Lily Oxpecker—no longer a constable, now Director Oxpecker—moved with crisp authority. In this timeline she had never been dragged out of Interpol by Mouse’s eccentric crusades. She had stayed, climbed, mastered the labyrinth of bureaucracy and power. She was poised, commanding, a name whispered with respect from Paris to Panama. But her eyes, as she glanced up from the files, held a flicker of the old curiosity she once shared with the Inspector on late-night stakeouts.

Mouse’s breath fogged the invisible glass between them. Henri plodding after minor villains, Lily ruling a paper empire. Together but not together, the spark of their odd partnership snuffed out before it had begun.

The Baron’s wingtip brushed his shoulder. “Some threads tangle without you,” he murmured. “Others straighten.”

The streetlight guttered, and both figures dissolved into the dark as the next window opened.

---  

They were over water now, a black river snaking past the city’s skyline. Neon trembled on its surface, all pinks and greens. A single building stood out, high up and alone, its glass walls glowing like a jewel box.

Inside, Monkey Tycoon was holding court. No Mouse Capone on the evening news. No daring train-top escapades to steal the cycle. He had grown fat and a little slow in his chair, believing himself untouchable. His lieutenants wore impeccable suits but their eyes flicked nervously to the windows.

A gloved hand flicked off a comm switch somewhere far below. A second later, the glass walls blew inward with a thunderclap of flashbulbs. They weren’t paparazzi. They were the Tonight Tonite’s—and their unmarked team of smiling, trench-coated operatives who worked out of a black-budget basement no one was supposed to know existed. In the regular timeline they were always two steps behind, chasing Mouse’s shadows across three continents. Without Mouse, they’d been free to map every offshore shell, every straw account, every hidden runway. And now they were here.

Monkey Tycoon’s tail curled around his glass of brandy, but his eyes went wide. The agents poured in like a wave of theatre ushers, polite and relentless. “Sir, it’s time to come with us.”  
  
The ticker running along the imploding building’s lobby monitors already showed the market plummeting, futures free-falling. The economy of three boroughs would dip for a season. Whole swaths of hustlers and workers would be left stranded.

On the riverbank, Mouse’s breath caught in his throat. “He… he escapes?”

The Red Baron Caterpillar fluttered his antennae. “Without you hogging the spotlight, yes. The world reorganizes its appetites. Sometimes faster, sometimes harsher.”

Through the jagged shards of glass from the tower, Monkey Tycoon’s helicopter dissolved like smoke. A last shot of his gold cufflink, spinning on the floor, and then even that winked out.

The Baron steered them upward again, the skyline folding back into stars.

---  

Mouse’s whiskers trembled as the Red Baron Caterpillar floated them down a corridor of night, its edges glittering like shattered glass. Every door they passed was a window into a life he might have never touched.

They stopped at a low-lit warehouse. Neon crackled against sheet-metal walls, and through a jagged opening Mouse could see Rudy the female mechanic lizard and Faraday the alligator technician. Both wore their trademark welding goggles like crowns. Both were laughing — that wild, reckless laugh Mouse remembered from a hundred improvised getaways.

Except here the laughter wasn’t his.
Here Rudy and Faraday were still running, still engineering impossible break-ins and hair-raising escapes — only for someone else. Their new crew wore unfamiliar colors. A jackal in a pinstripe coat barked orders. A sleek swan counted out shares from a glittering pile. Rudy snatched her cut with a mean grin. Faraday tossed a blowtorch from claw to claw like a toy.

“They’re fine,” Mouse murmured. “They’re still doing it.”

“Fine?” The Baron’s mandibles clicked softly. “They’re alive, yes. But what are they building, Mouse? Without you, no one ever taught them to slow down. No one ever challenged them to aim higher than just the next score.”

Inside the window Rudy was tweaking a bomb’s timer with one claw while drinking with the other. Faraday laughed, but it was a brittle sound. The jackal barked again and they both portended to straighten up, obedient, eyeing each other.

Mouse’s stomach turned. “They look… happy.”

“They look busy,” the Baron said. “They’ve traded danger for belonging, but it’s a belonging that can vanish the moment the cash dries up. Without your crew, without your odd, misfit loyalty, they never became more than the sum of their tricks.”

Mouse pressed a paw against the glass. “I didn’t think— I thought they’d be better off without me.”

“You all thought that once.” The Baron’s mechanical wings unfurled like torn velvet. “This is what the world does with strays when no one pulls them into something bigger.”

The window went dark. The smell of ozone lingered where Rudy’s blowtorch had been. Mouse’s paw hung in midair a heartbeat longer, then dropped to his side. He didn’t notice he was clenching it until his claws left tiny crescent marks in his palm.

“Come on,” said the Baron softly. “There’s still more to see.”

---  

Mouse’s claws curled. “Stop it. I’ve seen enough.”

“Not yet,” said the Caterpillar. “One more.”

He snapped his ledger again. Snow swirled, and now they stood before the rowhouse — tidy curtains, warm lamplight. Through the window sat cardigan-nerd Mouse and **Isabella Furrington**, with their two disfigured kittens, their families, and their cocoa.

“This is the life you could have had,” the Caterpillar said. “Safe. Respectable. Mundane. But no Minx, no Blue Puppy, no Featherstone. None of them.”

Mouse stared through the glass. The domestic scene glowed like a holiday card. He’d wondered about Isabella for years, about the road not taken. Now here it was, framed in frost.

He swallowed hard. “Looks nice,” he said.

“It is,” the Caterpillar said gently. “It’s also empty of uncertainty.”

Mouse watched cardigan-nerd Mouse chuckle at Isabella’s joke. Watched the kittens play. And felt a hollow grow in his chest.

“I guess…” he whispered, “Even with everything... Even with the screw-ups...”

The Caterpillar smiled, for the first time all night. “Then you’ve already got your answer.”  

---  

Snow whipped like ticker tape, the brownstone dissolved, and Mouse stumbled back into darkness. The Caterpillar’s voice trailed off behind him: “Go on then, go home, pal…”

He blinked. He was standing outside his own club — the same peeling neon sign, the same dented brass handle. Inside, the Tonight Tonite's were tuning up. Minx’s sax cut through the chatter like a blade of light.

Mouse pushed through the door. Warmth and sound wrapped around him. The club was full — not with strangers, but with his people. **Minx** onstage, tail flicking, coaxing a low, honey-smoked riff out of her horn. **Blue Puppy** darting between tables with a tray of mismatched drinks, yipping greetings, already forgetting the envelope fiasco. **Professor Featherstone** at the bar, feathers rumpled, reciting some obscure verse to **Rudy** and **Faraday**, who were both rolling their eyes but smiling.

No cardigans, no station wagon. Just the messy, miraculous crew he’d somehow assembled.

Mouse stayed in the doorway for a beat, letting the sound sink in. In the glow of the stage lights Minx caught his eye. She didn’t stop playing, but a small smile curved her mouth around the reed. It was the smile of someone who had been there at the start, who’d seen every near-miss, every harebrained plan, and still played on.

He crossed to the bar, ordered nothing, just stood and listened. For the first time all night the noise didn’t feel like a racket. It felt like proof.

Blue Puppy skidded up to him. “Boss! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost!”

Mouse ruffled the pup’s ears. “Something like that, kid.”

Onstage Minx shifted into a slow, swaying melody — a song about not tracking anymore dirt into the house. Mouse found himself grinning.

“Good to be home,” he murmured.

In the rafters, unnoticed, the **Red Baron Caterpillar** hovered a moment, ledger in hand. He scribbled something, snapped it shut, and with a satisfied hum wings appeared on his shoulders, and he zipped off into the night sky.

In the dimly lit room, the tension hung thick as Mouse Capone confronted Madame Gazelle, the air charged with accusations and the bitter taste of betrayal. Mouse's sharp gaze pierced through the shadows, demanding answers that Madame Gazelle was reluctant to provide.

""But why, Madame?"" Mouse's voice, usually smooth, carried an edge of frustration. ""We thought we were partners in this venture, but it seems you had your own clandestine deals.""

Madame Gazelle, her poise momentarily disrupted, hesitated before crafting her response. ""Mouse, my dear, sometimes alliances must be flexible. Snow Leopard offered terms that you couldn't dream of matching on a good day.""

Red Baron Caterpillar, caught in the crossfire, felt the weight of conflicting loyalties. He grappled with a personal crisis, torn between the camaraderie he'd formed with Mouse and the shocking revelation about Madame Gazelle.

As accusations flew and alliances shattered like fractured glass, the expedition transformed into a web of suspicion. Mouse and Red Baron, once allies, now questioned the motives of everyone involved. 

""What kind of terms is Snow Leopard offering?"" Red Baron wondered aloud.

The echoes of the Emberstorm had exposed not only the danger of elemental power but the fragility of trust in the face of shadowy ambitions. The fractured alliance cast a pall over their misadventure, leaving Mouse Capone and Red Baron Caterpillar navigating treacherous waters where loyalty was a scarce commodity.",,selftext,hdfidelity,hdfidelity,1,1,1.0,0,False,False,True,False,,,Expeditions and Misadventures ,self.hdfidelity,1757351496.0,2025-09-08T17:11:36+00:00

They wrote the rudest damn note that was so chock full of lies and rude blshit I said enough is enough number one I start stomping as hard as I can just trying to show them that crap isnt going to fly plus i was quiet before never even got a single issue or complaint ever about how loud I walk. I walk around all day youd think my dog would be waking up if this place was really such a bomb shelter like there describing but he can sleep all day.

Well last night she shows up at my door with a first degree burn all on her palm abd her and her boyfriend (lied and said it was her husband) start pointing at me cussing me out saying theyll call the copslike its my damn fault. All because apparently there Red Baron pretty well much melted in the back of the oven and because I dropped something upstairs she got scared and burnt her hand. 

Now heres where it gets good heres what I did i told them one second and came back with my phone playing John Frum Cargo Cult and they just look at me like sheep it was one of the funniest damn things ive ever seen and they just walk away.

The Old Legacy Skins Should Be for Sale a Few Times a Year,"I feel like the Legacy Vault should open a few times a year. Sometimes it not fun having to gamble with Hextech chests and Your Shop for skins that I want. I really want the nostalgia of having more legacy skins.

I feel like these skins below should be for sale a few times a year.

Have you been to any of these older cinemas in KL city?,"Older cinemas in KL featured in this post are Rex, Federal, Capitol, Odeon Chow Kit, Cathay, Pavilion, Coliseum, Sungei Wang cinema, Pudu, OUG, Odeon Central Market, Star, Majestic, Metropole, Golden City, Lido, Central, Madras, Sentul and Plaza Cinema. More information on these cinemas' past histories below.

• Image 1: Rex cinema, KLCC (1947–2002)

Prior to Rex's opening, it was known as Da Tung Hua Cinema Hall, which was opened during the early 1900s, and it was then torn down circa 1930. It was where Sun Yat-sen gave his speech in Kuala Lumpur to garner support for the Chinese Revolution in 1906.

Rex first opened on 3 August 1947 in Da Tung Hua's former site, with its first movie screened there being *Gilda*. It was operated by Shaw Organisation until February 1987, when it was taken over by Golden Communications (GC), which would later become Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) from 17 January 1998 onwards.

The cinema at one point was burned down by robbers in sixty seconds on 10 September 1975, with the movie screening there on that day being *Gone in 60 Seconds*.

It would subsequently reopen with a new look on 17 February 1977, with the first movie screened upon its reopening being *Executioners from Shaolin*. In 1993, it became the first cinema in Malaysia to have a DTS sound system with the release of *Jurassic Park* and also the first to have an SDDS sound system, and in 1995, the cinema's front foyer was then refurbished with computerised ticketing installed.

At one point, there was a Baskin-Robbins branch which used to operate in the cinema building as well.

It was closed down on 13 November 2002, with its last movie being the Indian Tamil film *Kadhal Azhivathillai*. The building was then formerly a hostel known as Red Dragon after the cinema closed down which would burn down again on 19 August 2007, and it would become abandoned after that.

The former cinema's building is now a multicultural creative and entrepreneurial hub called REXKL since September 2019.

• Image 2: Federal cinema, Chow Kit (1959–2001, 2007–2013, 2015–2021; located opposite to Capitol cinema)

Opened on 6 February 1959 with its first movie screened there being *The Vikings* with the guest of honor at the cinema's opening event being then-prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. It was then operated by Shaw until 1987, when it was taken over by GC, which would later become GSC from 1998 onwards. The first opening ceremony of the Malaysian Film Festival (FFM) would be held there on 11 April 1980.

In 1991, it became a 2-screen cinema known as Federal 1 & 2, with the stalls section and main auditorium converted to hall 1, and the circle seats upstairs converted to hall 2. There used to be a McDonald's branch that used to operate in the Federal cinema's ground floor.

It was closed down on 31 August 2001. The cinema's building would then become a pub, and the cinema would be reopened by Kumpulan Pawagam Iswaria (KPI) on 31 May 2007 as a cinema screening Hindi and Tamil movies.

The cinema's operations was then taken over by Pyramid Saimira on 2008, followed by Federal Group on 2010 until February 2013 which was when the cinema would close down again. It is believed that the cinema was investigated by the Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor (Syabas) for illegally securing their water supply by tapping into the local water main, which had subsequently led to the cinema's closure in 2013.

The cinema would then reopen under Suara from 5 February 2015 until it was closed again in 2021. The former cinema's building is now Gawala Food Mall as of now.

• Image 3: Capitol cinema, Chow Kit (1956–2000; located opposite to Federal cinema)

It opened on 11 February 1956 with its first movie screened there being *Helen of Troy*. It was operated by Shaw until 1987, when it was taken over by GC, which would later become GSC from 1998 onwards.

It was closed down on 19 December 2000 with the Indian Hindi movie *Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye* being its last movie screened there.

As of now, the old building is still intact albeit with Mek Tomyam restaurant and Wan Lee Heng Cash & Carry wholesale grocer occupying its space currently.

• Image 4: Odeon cinema, Chow Kit (1936–1997, 2000–2010, 2011–2015)

It was formerly operated by Cathay when it first opened in 1936 until 1984, and then by Cathay Borneo Film Organisation (BFO) until May 1990. Pavilion Theatres (which would later become Mega Pavilion from 9 August 1997 onwards, and then Cathay Cineplexes from 27 May 2006, and as of now, mmCineplexes since 21 May 2016) would then take over the cinema operations once most of Cathay's Malaysian operations were bought by PPB and PNB, with Singapore's Cathay Organisation thus forming Pavilion.

The cinema would then close down in November 1997. It would then reopen in 2000 after renovations, with KPI taking over its operations. In 2004, the cinema was split into 2 halls with the back portion of the cinema being renovated into a restaurant. Pyramid Saimira would then take over KPI's ownership of the cinema in 2008.

In 2010, a fire broke out which was believed to be in the kitchen of the restaurant or in the AHU of the building. The cinema would then close down afterwards, with parts of the building being turned into an arcade selling clothes, magazines, electronic goods and snacks.

The cinema would then reopen again in 27 May 2011 with extensive renovations made, this time with Antenna Entertainments taking over its operations. Despite that, it would then permanently close its doors in 2015.

Currently, the former cinema's building has been renovated to become a multipurpose event venue.

• Image 5: Cathay cinema, Bukit Bintang (1958–1997; located opposite to Pavilion cinema)

Opened in 1958 with its first movie screened there being *Campbell's Kingdom*. It was formerly operated by Cathay until 1984, and then by Cathay BFO until 1990. Pavilion would then take over the cinema's operations until the cinema's closure on December 1997.

The former cinema's building then became a discotheque until December 2002, when it was then demolished. Currently as of now, a hotel is being built on the site.

• Image 6: Pavilion cinema, Bukit Bintang (1935–1997; located opposite to Cathay cinema)

Opened in 1935, it was the first Cathay Organisation cinema. The cinema's operations would then be taken over by Cathay BFO from 1984, and then Pavilion Theatres from 1990 onwards along with other cinemas in KL including Odeon and Cathay.

It would then close in 1997, and the building would then be converted into a dance club. By 2000, the cinema's former building had been demolished to become a car park.

• Image 7: Coliseum cinema, KLCC (1920–)

Opened in 1920, it was the first cinema to open in Malaysia. It was initially a theatre that had staged Bangsawan shows during the 1930s. It would then switch to screening Hindi and Tamil movies. It was then owned by businessman, property developer and philanthropist Chua Cheng Bok until his demise in 1940. His estate would then take over the cinema's operations, and in 1973, it was then acquired by a company led by Chua Cheng Bok's nephew Chua Boon Teck and his wife Khor Joo Saik.

At one point, the cinema's operations was then taken over by Cathay Organisation, and later on Cathay BFO in 1984 until 1990. PPB and PNB would then purchase Cathay's Malaysian operations in 1990, with GSC then taking over in 1998. The cinema's operations would then be taken over by Khor Joo Saik Sdn. Bhd. during the 2000s.

Lotus Five Star would then purchase the cinema, and it would then convert it to a 2-hall cinema known as LFS Coliseum Cineplex which opened on 1 November 2012. It is still operating to this day, thus making this cinema the longest-running one in Malaysia currently.

• Image 8: Sungei Wang cinema (1978–2000)

Sungei Wang cinema first opened in 1978 during Chinese New Year. It was owned by Solar Organisation, and later on GC from 1990 until 1998, when it was then taken over by GSC. It would close down in 2000.

Sungei Wang cinema's former site would be then taken over by a ladies beauty accessories marketplace which would only last for a few years. Once the marketplace closed down, the space was left unoccupied. Mega Star Arena would then take over the area from 2023 onwards.

There was also the President cinema which opened at the same date as the Sungei Wang cinema. It was also initially owned by Solar, and it was then taken over by GC and later on GSC as well. It would also close down in 2000.

In the now-demolished BB Plaza which was connected to Sungei Wang Plaza, there was the Century Cineplex with 2 halls that was owned by Pavilion Theatres which operated from 9 November 1993 until 1996.

On the former site of both Sungei Wang (opened on 25 December 1977) and BB Plaza (opened in 1979) used to be Bukit Bintang Park amusement park which operated during the 1930s until 1972, when it was demolished to make way for those 2 malls. There were 4 cinemas in the park which were Rialto, Sun, Canton and Moonlight, all operated by Shaw back then.

The Rialto cinema was originally known as Capitol until 1956, when another cinema located in Chow Kit and was also operated by Shaw with the same name opened. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, it was known as Tokyo Gekizye. The Moonlight cinema did not last as long in comparison to the other 3 cinemas which operated until BB Park's demolition.

• Image 9: Pudu cinema (1978–2000; connected to Wisma Shaw / Shaw Parade)

The cinema first opened in 1978, with the first movie screened there being *The 36th Chamber of Shaolin*. It was formerly operated by Shaw until 1987, when it was then taken over by GC. The cinema most likely continued to operate until 2000, and hence in 1998, the cinema would be operated by GSC during its last few years.

• Image 10: OUG cinema (1983–2000; connected to Plaza OUG)

The cinema first opened in June 1983. It was operated by Cathay Organisation until 1984, and then Cathay BFO until 1990, which was when PPB and PNB would then purchase BFO's ownership in Cathay's Malaysian operations. By 1998, it was then taken over by GSC, and it would most likely close down in 2000. The former cinema's building would then be turned into an F&B zone, which along with Plaza OUG would then be demolished since 1 August 2022 to make way for The Legacy OUG, a mixed development consisting of a new shopping mall, hotel and service apartment.

• Image 11: Odeon Cineplex, Central Market (1990–2002)

Note: Images of Odeon Central Market taken from 12 May 1990, 23 July 1992 and 2 June 1999 issues of the New Straits Times through Google News Archive.

Odeon Cineplex in Central Market opened on 26 April 1990 with 2 halls, with the first movies screened in the cineplex being *The War of the Roses*, the Malay film *Driving School*, and the Hong Kong Cantonese film *My Neighbours Are Phantoms* albeit with midnight shows only. It was operated by Cathay BFO upon the cinema's opening briefly until May 1990, and then by Cathay until 1998, when it was taken over by GSC. It would close down on January 2002. Odeon Cineplex Central Market is now the Central Market Annexe building which at one point was known as Central Square.

• Image 12: Star cinema, Pudu (1957–2000)

The cinema first opened in 1957 and was operated by Eng Wah Organisation. By 2000, the cinema was demolished and would become a car park. As of now, the Emart complex currently stands in the former cinema's site.

• Image 13: Majestic cinema, Pudu (1930s–1984)

The cinema first opened during the 1930s, with operations being handled by Golden Star Organisation. It was then closed down in 1984. The building was then demolished in 2006. A hotel known as the D'Majestic Place by Swiss-Garden currently stands in the cinema's former site.

• Image 14: Metropole cinema, Pudu (1956–1984)

Opened in 1956, the cinema was operated by Kong Ngee Organisation. It would then close down in July 1984. The cinema building was then demolished, and a love hotel known as the Richmoore Hotel has been built in its former place which has been operating since the early 1990s.

• Image 15: Golden City cinema, Jalan Ipoh (1970s–1986, 1988–1991)

The cinema first opened during the 1970s under Golden Star. It would close down in 1986, though it would then reopen in 1988. The cinema would finally close down in 1991.

The now-closed Dynasty Hotel and the Golden City Condominium both of which were completed in 1995 currently stands in the former cinema's location.

• Image 16: Lido cinema, Brickfields (1940–1950, 1951–1984, 1984–1986)

It was a theatre known as Prince cinema which opened in 1936. On 2 April 1940, the theatre building was already demolished with a cinema known as Cathay being built in its site. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, the cinema was known as Nico Han. Cathay cinema in Brickfields would close on 23 August 1950.

On 15 May 1951, the cinema would reopen once it was acquired by Shaw from Cathay, and it would then be renamed as Lido once renovations made to the cinema were complete.

On 29 August 1984, the cinema under Shaw would close down, though on 12 October at the same year, it was then taken over by Amarjit Pictures, an Indian film distributor operating in Malaysia and Singapore. The cinema's last movie on 30 September 1986 before it was closed down was a Tamil movie *Nandri*.

What currently stands at the cinema's former site is a building consisting of a Public Bank branch and Bangsar dental clinic on its upper floors.

• Image 17: Central cinema, KLCC (1946–1984)

The cinema first opened on 23 October 1946 by Shaw. It would then close down on 28 May 1984. Amarjit would purchase the cinema from Shaw and thus renovate it once it had took over.

The cinema would never reopen as on 25 September 1984 while the cinema was undergoing renovations, it would be destroyed from a fire. As of now, an apartment building known as the CapSquare Residence currently stands in the cinema's former location.

• Image 18: Madras cinema, KLCC (1938–1978; located a few blocks away from Rex cinema)

Prior to the cinema's opening, it was a Chinese theatre. The theatre was then rebuilt to become the Madras cinema which was owned by Shaw and was first opened in 1938. The cinema was one of the earliest cinemas in KL.

On 10 October 1978, the cinema burned down during a 1 pm screening of a Mandarin film *Secret Message*. The cinema was never rebuilt, and as of now, it has already been demolished to become a car park.

• Image 19: Sentul cinema (1973–1984, 2007–2017)

It opened on 24 October 1973 with the first movie screening there being *Redneck* and it was then operated by Shaw. It closed down in 1984, and it would then become a furniture retail store and later on a seafood restaurant.

In 2007, the cinema reopened independently under its then-new owner Mr. Sivam. In 2009, the cinema was then taken over by LFS. Since 15 December 2017, the cinema has been closed down and thus demolished to make way for the Rica Residences condominium.

• Image 20: Plaza Cinema, Imbi (late 1970s–late 1980s)

The cinema opened during the late 1970s. It was then operated by Eng Wah. Before its official opening, a preview screening of a documentary on the Sino-Vietnamese war was held in the cinema. In the cinema building was Imbi Furniture Warehouse.

Not much else is known about this cinema. It might had most likely closed down during the late 1980s. The former cinema building was then demolished to make way for what is now The Nest food court, Shu Xiang Hotpot and Restaurant Wealthy Garden.

Got hit with a huge estimate afterwards,"Hey guys.  I could use some advice.

A few weeks ago I was at the mart with my  children. My son was being difficult to get in his car seat. I eventually got him in the car. I went to put my cart back and when getting back to the car a woman claimed I dinged her car when getting him in. This seemed plausible but I didn't think a parking lot was a good place to resolve this. I got her information and assumed she was being honest. She seemed very worried about her car. It is about a 6 year old BMW. Not top end , but not cheap.

I texted her as soon as I got home as a gesture of good faith. I told her I would see the bill before deciding how to proceed.Well she sent me a bill for over 600,000 won. It's apparently her husband's car and he added things like weather strips for the sides of the door in the estimate. Just the straps are nearly 200k.  The size of the scratch is about the size of a fingernail.  Another weird thing, it's not from a BMW repair shop, it's from a small shop. He claims the BMW shop quoted 1.5 million.

Anyone have any advice?

We started a company roughly 6 years ago called Keto Corner Bakery.

I have an entrepreneurial background.

Our brand is called ""Sinless"".  The Sinless brand specializes in zero sugar, low carb, and healthy desserts and snacks.  We started selling locally online, and quickly had interest from retail.  Our cakes were sold at the Bristol Farms and Gelson's grocery stores.  At the time, we didn't have the manufacturing or freezer storage capability and our costs were too high, so we exited the retail space.  However, we still have our relationship with Kehe distributor.  We're looking for an Angel to come on board at a very attractive valuation.

We have an industry expert as part of our team but we need some capital to see the strategy through.

We're asking for $75K.

Please send a message if interested or would like additional details.

We initially thought about ordering from Jon and Vinny's since it would only be a couple of minutes from where we're staying, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed unreasonable to do all of that.

So I figured I'd come on here to see what the local recs are for a good pizza that can feed a group without breaking the bank too much?

SERIOUSLY. if you don't have all the time in the world then ranked is not an option. it's either you have the stick and you meet someone and kill them (unless they have the sickle and shield in which case you will bleed out and die eventually) or they have the stick and they kill you.

we can atleast be a bit considerate, right? it feels so scummy to just use the ""EQUIP TO WIN"" tools that aren't even that fun to use when you could have a loadout that you actually like, but it doesn't matter because people will equip the fucking stick and sickle and shield and the inbleedable unstabbable armor and win and fucking hell i hate ranked so so so much",,selftext,BloodyBastardsGame,IceTubeDoesReddit,5,5,0.86,12,False,False,True,False,,,,self.BloodyBastardsGame,1758099555.0,2025-09-17T08:59:15+00:00

This is how I got into Kpop from Blackpink to Newjeans,"It all started in **December** 2024 when APT song was trending everywhere, especially on TikTok. I liked the song and was vibing to it. At first, it didn’t cause any issue, but since then TT kept showing me BP content, and I ended up binging on them. By late **February** 2025, I felt like I might actually be starting to like BP and in early **March** I felt positive that I'm into BP and somehow I didn't feel comfortable with it bc they were too popular for me to stan. (I typically stan something that no one else in town knows about, plus it's weird for me to like a Kpop group bc I'm not that guy - I used to think if you like Kpop then you have a bad taste in music) At this phase everything hit different, I started to feel uncomfortable whenever I saw anything BP related including APT song. At one point, I was at the computer with my colleague and we accidentally bump on a video about APT on Youtube, my heart started pounding and I didn't feel good so I went to the restroom to calm down, I begged 'Please get rid of this feeling I had for BP' and I really meant it. Around that time I decided to uninstall TT. Moving forwards to mid **March**, I went to a minimarket and saw NewJeans on a Pepero box, never heard of them before, and after going there a couple of times, things crossed my mind 'what if I check out another girl group, maybe it can distract me for BP' so I decided to start finding out about NJ, I watched lot of clips of them on X. Whenever I think about BP I quickly watch NJ videos. Anyway, since that, a lot of NJ stuff flooding my feed, and I learned they were involved in a lawsuit that I didn't really understand at that point, I was like what is Hybe? what is Ador? who is Hanni? I was so desperate to escape BP so I ate all the articles and news about NJ to distract me from BP.

During that phase, a couple of times I felt like 'Nah NJ isn't for me' but I kept watching them anyway bc my knowledge about other gg was very limited. Before 2025 a Kpop gg I knew were only SNSD, BP and FiftyFifty, I remember when I was a freshman, my friend told me he likes SNSD, at that time Mr. Simple was popular, I think it was around 2011, so that was the very first time I came across Kpop. Back to topic, In early **April** I think I started to like NJ for real (I kept it secret ofc, I had few friends who were into kpop, if they knew I like a Kpop group I'll be embarrassed for life) and I binged watching their clips on insta and YT shorts, clips I watched were a diary-like videos. All of the sudden their lawsuit news started to make me uncomfortable, but I ignored it, so I kept eating their updates on X and a megathread, I really went down the NJ rabbit hole and Kpop in general, big mistake!. I kept binging on NJ clips all the way to **May**, my feeling for BP slowly fade away, I swear everything had been shifted to NJ but it's far from better. I started to feel infuriated by the drama around them, like I had my own problems and I don't need to get caught up in other people’s mess, plus the football team I support has been in the downfall era for years so I've had enough of problems. By mid-May, my feelings for NJ growing stronger but at the same time I didn’t want to get invested, I felt that was the sign I needed to stop, and I realized I was just playing with fire. I took a break from reddit and quit X for good, I decided to stay away from anything NJ related, when I went to the minimarket I tried my best not to stare at the Pepero boxes.

Now, I hadn’t watched any of NJ’s clips for months. During that time I re-installed TT, since my feelings for BP had gone away I can enjoy APT again, it distracted me a bit from NJ but a few NJ related videos somehow sneaked into my fyp, I scrolled quick, I almost got heart attack whenever vt about NJ popped up. As for their music, I haven't heard much, only Ditto and a bit of Super Shy, tbh Kpop is still not my cup of tea. I listened to Ditto on repeat and I still couldn't understand why people think it's a good song, to me most Kpop songs sound similar, if you play Ditto and then you play any IVE song, and tell people that the two songs were form the same group, they'd believe you. I don't think there are any idols who have a recognizable voice. Apart from APT (if it's count as Kpop) Kpop songs which I think had quality were Cupid and Love Shot. I wasn't actually a fan of today's music in general either, there were only few songs in the last 10 years that made it into my playlist, I think Coldplay haven't made a great song since Viva La Vida. Deep inside there's still part of me who wants to explore NJ mvs and engage in Kpop community, but I know if I'm doing that there's no return for me. I wonder if Kpop industry put a spell on you, I mean, they knew human psychology well, they knew how to get you hooked and to make you like them. My knowledge about Kpop group is going to the moon this year, I somehow ended up knowing the likes of NCT, Enhypen, IVE, Kiikii, Triple S, Kepler, Meovvy, Illit, Seventeen, Kiss of Life, Gfriend, Gdragon etc, somehow a little part of me felt embarrassed for knowing all those, other part of me feels like you can’t be a fan of a Kpop group and think you’re the coolest person on earth, BUT I'm more open to Kpop songs now, if there's a banger I'll take it as a guilty pleasure. 2025 has been the year of something else, I wish I could go back to January when my life was still normal.",,selftext,kpoppers,Gullible-Distance594,2,2,0.56,3,False,False,True,False,,,Discussion,self.kpoppers,1757077524.0,2025-09-05T13:05:24+00:00

[Father's Day](https://preview.redd.it/4bj2uuo3honf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f79e07daad28a0fbd0b1dbd240d8f60ff0eb489)

For those of you in the UK or US going ""Uh?"" - New Zealand doesn't have Father's Day on the same day as the rest of you. In fact, there's quite a bit of variation around the world.

This is true of many holidays - whether you get a day off or not - and it can for some reason be quite a surprise to folk who aren't quite as global in outlook as perhaps they could be.

Independence Days are a good example. The United Kingdom is the world's foremost exporter of Independence Days, and while they don't have one themselves, they've helped create them in countries as diverse as USA, India, Singapore, Kenya, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, and many more. These are all on different days because not everyone waved farewell on the same day.

Furthermore, there are plenty of countries that celebrate things (day off or not) that others don't:

* **Japan** has a Greenery Day (4 May)
* **S. Korea** has Pepero Day (11 Nov)
* **India** has Holi (Dates vary)
* **Ethiopia** has Enkutatash (11 Sep)
* **Scotland** has Burns Night (25 Jan)
* **USA** has Columbus Day (2nd Mon in October)
* **Mongolia** has Naadam (11-13 July)
* **New Zealand** has Waitangi Day (6 Feb)
* **New Zealand** has Matariki (Dates vary)

... and there are many, many more.

Due to pan-global diaspora, many countries are lucky enough to get celebrations that aren't altogether originally familiar to them. A good example being India's Holi - which is experiencing a surge in popularity in New Zealand... and Burns Night, which can be enjoyed by many who live anywhere there's a *ceilidh* of Scotsfolk in proximity.

But Mother's Day and Father's Day - which frequently don't have a set calendar day - have become highly promoted in recent years mainly because of the sledgehammer of commercial interest. They therefore tend to be afterthoughts in a modern world that is potentially rushing about far too quickly for its own good.

But my lot forgot about Father's Day.",,selftext,VillainyGroup,Psygnal,1,1,1.0,0,False,False,True,False,,,Rant / Story,self.VillainyGroup,1757222688.0,2025-09-07T05:24:48+00:00

I don't think there are any idols who have a recognizable voice. Apart from APT (if it's count as Kpop) Kpop songs which I think had quality were Cupid and Love Shot. I wasn't actually a fan of today's music in general either, there were only few songs in the last 10 years that made it into my playlist, I think Coldplay haven't made a great song since Viva La Vida. Deep inside there's still part of me who wants to explore NJ mvs and engage in Kpop community, but I know if I'm doing that there's no return for me. I wonder if Kpop industry cast a 'spell' on you, I mean, they knew human psychology well, they knew how to get you hooked and to make you like them. My knowledge about Kpop group is going to the moon this year, I somehow ended up knowing the likes of NCT, Enhypen, IVE, Kiikii, Triple S, Kepler, Meovvy, Illit, Seventeen, Kiss of Life, Gfriend, Gdragon etc, somehow a little part of me felt embarrassed for knowing all those, other part of me feels like you can’t be a fan of a Kpop group and think you’re the coolest person on earth, BUT I'm more open to Kpop songs now, if there's a banger I'll take it as a guilty pleasure. 2025 has been the year of something else, I wish I could go back to January when my life was still normal.",,selftext,kpopthoughts,Gullible-Distance594,0,0,0.13,14,False,False,True,False,,,Discussion,self.kpopthoughts,1758265554.0,2025-09-19T07:05:54+00:00

I saw an article saying I was selected for the Asian Games. In that taxi, my whole career replayed in my head. The happiness I felt in that moment was indescribable.","[https://www.sooplive.com/video/153119](https://www.sooplive.com/video/153119)

**1. How does it feel to be considered one of the greatest AD carries in League of Legends history?**

Of course, it feels great. Being evaluated that way in a specific field is something to be proud of in itself, so I’m happy.

**2. Ruler, it’s been a while? What are your thoughts on the newly revealed 2025 Worlds uniforms?** 

Honestly, I don’t really know if the 2025 Worlds jersey looks good or not. I’m not too sure, maybe because our company is American, so there are challenges? They have their own philosophy? That’s how I feel. But I wouldn’t say it looks bad.

**3. What is your favorite Worlds theme song or LOL music video?**

 I don’t really watch Worlds MVs, so I’m not sure. Among the songs, *Legends Never Die* is probably the best.

**4. You always shine on the Worlds stage! Can you share your Worlds mindset every time you step onto that stage?**

I don’t think as much as people imagine. Even though it’s called “the big stage,” I just approach it with the mindset of playing a game. So I don’t think too much, I just try to do things the usual way and keep my mentality steady.

**5. When you were in China, was there food you especially missed?**

Spicy chicken with chili seasoning, cut into pieces. Ah? You mean Korean food? Sorry. In 2023, there was an ajumma (lady) who cooked Korean food for us every meal, so I didn’t really miss anything. Well, maybe fried chicken, but she cooked pork belly or beef for me, so it was fine. There’s Kyochon Fried Chicken in Beijing, but I lived in the suburbs, and when I ordered delivery, it didn’t taste that good.

**6. How is your back these days? Do you still do exercises or Pilates regularly?**

My back’s fine, but my neck and shoulders have some issues. I still do pilates. Since about 3–4 months ago, I’ve also been going to the gym myself and working out hard. On pilates days, I do one hour of pilates and one hour of cardio. On non-pilates days, I do weight training and cardio for two days. GEN really takes care of me, so I exercise consistently. Recently, my wrist has been a bit uncomfortable.

**7. What was the most memorable moment of this year for you?**

None yet, actually. We’ve been winning continuously, so I’m very happy, but nothing has been deeply memorable. Honestly, vacations feel more memorable, because I barely get any time off, so just resting feels really nice.

**8. If you were born again, what career would you want to pursue?**

I don’t know what I’d choose, but I’d want to go to college. If I were reborn, I wouldn’t be a pro player again. Being a singer or rapper is a bit unrealistic. More realistically, I’d just take whatever part-time jobs I could find, then apply and interview if a company was hiring. Finding work seems tough. The reason I wouldn’t choose pro play again is because, while I gained a lot, I also missed out on even more. Being a pro requires sacrificing too much.

**9. During matches your POV camera often only shows you and the monitor-how do you manage that?**

**10. Which AD carry champion is your favorite?**

Right now, Kai’Sa and Zeri, they’re really fun.

**11. What dish are you most confident in cooking?** 

Everyone, I’m actually good at cooking now, I’m not the Ruler you used to know. I can stir-fry dishes with a pan. Dishes I can make? Spicy braised chicken, tteokbokki, spicy stir-fried pork, gochujang pork belly, braised chicken… I think I’ve made all of those. People don’t believe me, huh? Next time I cook, I’ll take a picture and upload it.

 **12. Has there been a teammate’s play that trule impressed you?**

I don’t really remember specific plays. I think their performances every game are cool.

 **13. Besides Duro, can you match your teammates (including yourself) with characters from Attack on Titan?**

**14. Which pentakill is the most memorable to you?**

The one in the LPL more than the LCK. It was my debut match in the LPL, and I got my first pentakill against BLG. I thought they weren’t playing well, but they were actually really strong. Since it was my first game, I couldn’t speak Chinese and didn’t know what my teammates were saying. But I got a pentakill in my first match, and I felt I played really well.

**15. Theres a saying that you only play Samsung Galaxy Xayah when you really want to win. Can you fact-check this?**

Yes. I don’t think I ever actually said that, but somehow the rumor spread. I don’t know why. It’s not really true. These days, I usually just use Samsung Xayah. In the past, I preferred other skins, but since a couple of years ago, pros often used Samsung Xayah, and fans liked it when I used it, so I started using it more.

**16. Was there ever a moment where you thought, “I felt like the captain”?**

Honestly, never. I used to think captains could create something, but since around 2020… players are all from the MZ generation now, so it’s hard. Even coaches have MZ personalities.

**17. What song have you been listening to the most recently? Also, what’s your favorite music genre?**

I listen to ballads and rap a lot. My playlist has both, so I just shuffle songs. But my favorite is ballads. At karaoke, I often sing songs by Kim Dong-ryul, Jang Beom-june, Yoon Do-hyun, and Sung Si-kyung. But I can’t hit high notes, so I only sing songs that don’t go too high.\\

**18. In your opinion, what is a must have AD carry skin?**

I think the old Pulsefire Ezreal before the rework was a must-buy. Now it’s IG Kai’Sa.

 **19. If Duro were your older brother, what do you think it would be like?**

Is it a feeling? It’s a good feeling. I should just take off my rank and go for it. We should fight each other and become gag masters, who ever wins becomes the hyung. I call him Mingyu, “Mingyu hyung”? Oh I cant imagine this, but is this what it means to call him Miingyu hyung? Even Mingyu wouldn’t imagine this. Cant you imagine it either? That I’m your older brother. I cant imagine it, it’s not easy. 

**Bonus: Why don’t you use Corgi Corki skin?**

When I use it, Corki’s body feels heavy, and the skills feel inaccurate, so I don’t really play with that skin.

**20. What kind of words or encouragement give you the most strength?**

Something like, “You’ve built some muscle!” Because I’m working out these days, words like that give me strength. Just kidding. I used to have really fair skin, but then my skin got a lot worse. Don’t say stuff like, “If you spend money, your skin will get better,” because I really *have* spent a lot of money. My dad also had bad skin when he was young, it’s hereditary.

**Bonus: Always have perfect skin no matter what vs. never gain weight no matter what you eat?**

Never gain weight no matter what I eat. My skin’s already bad.

**21. Between game sense (brain) and mechanics (hands), which one do you think is your stronger stat?**

I think I’m more of the game-sense type. People see League as a mechanical game, and both are important, of course. But I think game sense matters more. Hitting skillshots is mechanics, but League is about game sense, you have to predict your opponent and then use skills. Things like instant reactions are mechanics, though.

**22. The weather keeps changing between hot and humid- how are you taking care of your health these days?**

I’ve been exercising a lot lately. I work out hard and maintain my health. I’ve also lost quite a bit of weight.

 **23. Can you sum up your determination for the rest of the year in five words?**

“Enjoy the game with fun.” Saying stuff like “I’ll win the championship” is too cliché. I think you have to enjoy the game to get good results, so I’ll try hard. I believe playing happily leads to victories.

 **24. GGX’s Ruler fried rice is the best! Do you also enjoy kimchi fried rice?**

I really like kimchi fried rice, it’s so good. But it makes you gain weight too easily, so I can’t eat it often. GGX has a lot of real dishes named after players, so everyone should try them. If someday I can cook it for fans, I will. Personally, I like adding Spam. If I had to choose between Spam and tuna, I’d pick Spam. I don’t like tuna. Pork belly is number one, though. Normally, kimchi fried rice doesn’t have Spam, it usually has sausage. But I like putting it in. You said lately adding Spam or pork belly tastes good? When I was younger, I liked sausage in it. No cheese, because of weight control. Fried egg on top is always great—not only tasty but also healthy.

**25. What was the happiest moment of your pro career?**

The Asian Games made me really happy, and winning MSI 2023 also made me very happy. In 2022, I gave up the Asian Games to focus on the league and won the LCK. Then I transferred to JDG. By then I had already given up on the Asian Games, but the recruitment announcement said players active overseas could still be considered depending on results. I thought, “What’s this? I’m really lucky.” Then we won Spring and I thought, “Huh, we actually won.” That led to MSI. Honestly, I thought we wouldn’t win MSI, I thought the LCK would. But the moment we beat T1, I felt we’d win. Then BLG suddenly beat all the LCK teams and made finals, and I thought, “What is this?” Since we had never lost to BLG, I felt confident we’d win. When we did and I held the trophy, I was incredibly happy, happiness beyond words. Then on the way to the airport, the agency called me and told me to check the news. I saw an article saying I was selected for the Asian Games roster. In that taxi, my whole career replayed in my head. The happiness I felt in that moment was indescribable. But 2023 was really tough, the schedule was brutal, but it was rewarding. I’m very thankful to those who supported us in 2023. This year’s schedule? Also hell. No rest at all.

**26. If you win Worlds, what celebration would you do?**

Kiss the trophy. It’s been so long since I’ve done that, I haven’t seen a Worlds trophy in ages.

**27. Do you have any hobbies outside of gaming or hidden talents?**

Like I said earlier, cooking. Unfortunately, I don’t really have other talents.

**28.  If you win the championship this year, which champion would you choose for your skin?**

 Kai’Sa, Zeri, or Janna. If I get Finals MVP, then one more skin would be nice. You have to pick a champion that looks good, that’s the only way it sells well.

**29. Have you ever cooked for your Gen.G teammates? If so, how did they react? If not, how do you think they would react?**

Sadly, no. If I did, I think they’d react really well. I want to cook for them, but I haven’t had the chance.

**30. What is something you want to achieve together with Gen.G in the future?**

My goal is to accumulate more achievements in my career. Ultimately, achieving good results so that both GEN and I can win together is the goal.

**31. Can you recommend an anime you’ve enjoyed recently?**

*Attack on Titan*. Although I was a bit disappointed with the last episode, it was really interesting. This time I binge-watched the whole thing, and it was very good. Between *Attack on Titan* and *Demon Slayer*, I think *Demon Slayer* is better.

**32. Do you have any in-game habits or rituals while playing?**

Not during matches, but before matches I chew gum. I’ve cut down on it. Before, I would chew two pieces before a match, if I won, I’d chew one; if I lost, I’d spit it out and chew two again. Now I chew one piece, if I lose, I spit it out and chew another; if I win, I just keep chewing. My stomach is fine, I don’t get discomfort from it.

**33. If you could only use one emote in-game, which would you choose?**

The 2017 SSG emote.

**34. You’ve scored over 40 quadra kills - was there one that stood out the most?**

There are two candidates: one where YoungJae stole my first pentakill, and another where a Jayce QE combo stole it. Please pick one, I’ll just leave it as two candidates.

**35. If GEN debuted as an idol dance group, what positions would your teammates have?**

I don’t want to do that, it doesn’t feel right. Honestly, none of my four teammates really fit that, so I won’t pick.

**36. As an AD carry, what do you think is the single most important thing in competitive or solo queue games?**

Dying less. Unless it’s unavoidable, you should minimize deaths as much as possible. Of course, you also need to play lane well, and then again, die as little as possible.

 **37. You haven’t uploaded workout stories on Instagram lately,  did you stop exercising?**

 Not at all. I just felt like posting workout stories every day looked like I was showing off. So I stopped uploading, but I still work out almost every day.

**38. In your opinion, what was the most perfect play of your career so far?**

There are so many matches, I can’t remember clearly. But the Kai’Sa game against KT, after we secured Baron, the teamfight in midlane stands out. It went exactly as I had envisioned it, that fight was just like the situation I imagined.

**39. You once picked Gen.G vs DRX in 2022 as your best LCK match-what about your best match in the LPL, MSI, and Worlds?**

In the LPL, the Zeri 2v4. For MSI, the 2023 MSI vs. T1 Jinx game, against K’Sante, I played very well. For Worlds, not sure… maybe the 2023 match against KT.

 **40. Finally could you share your mindset going into the LCK playoffs and Worlds?**

I’ll do my best to make it to the very end. Thank you.",,selftext,leagueoflegends,Yujin-Ha,817,817,0.97,63,False,False,True,False,,,Esports,self.leagueoflegends,1757443432.0,2025-09-09T18:43:52+00:00
